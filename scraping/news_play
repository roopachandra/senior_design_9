Former Fox News contributor Julie Roginsky tells CNN's Brian Stelter that the network is continuing "to put people at risk" by downplaying the risks of the coronavirus pandemic. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
(CNN) Millions of people across India have been placed under lockdown until the end of the month as efforts to halt the spread of the novel coronavirus in the country intensify.

Residents living in 75 districts across the country, including in major cities such as the capital New Delhi, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Hyderabad, and Kolkata have been placed under travel, work and movement restrictions until March 31.

India -- the world's second most populous country -- has 415 cases of the coronavirus, including seven deaths, according to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare. A sudden rise in cases has led to growing concerns over the country's capacity to test for the virus and that a major outbreak on the scale seen in Europe -- the pandemic's new epicenter -- will spread in the country.

Dr. Balram Bhargava, director-general of the Indian Council of Medical Research, said that India has conducted 5,000 tests in the past week and a total of 15,000 so far. There are 111 labs operational with a per week testing capacity of 60,000 to 70,000 and around 60 more private labs are in the process of being approved to further increase testing capacity, according to Bhargava.

The decision to lock down parts of the country comes after India launched the world's biggest exercise in social distancing on Sunday, with the nation's 1.3 billion people asked to observe a self-imposed quarantine for 14 hours.

From 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Sunday, offices and businesses shut, people stayed inside their homes, and the usually busy streets, markets and highways were eerily empty across the nation. In a display of public solidarity expressing thanks to the nation's healthcare workers, people across India stood in their doorways and on balconies applauding, ringing bells and blowing conch shells, following similar scenes days prior in Italy and Spain.

The "public curfew," announced by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi last week, was a test on whether an official curfew could be imposed across the country to stop the spread of Covid-19 . Those restrictions were extended across large parts of the country late Sunday, effectively forcing millions of workers in India's huge technology and financial sector to work from home for the rest of the month.

In New Delhi, public transportation, including the metro and rickshaws, has been suspended, all shops, factories, places of worship and offices have been shut, interstate travel has stopped, borders with neighboring states have closed and people are required to stay in their homes until March 31.

Exempt from the order are essential services such as grocery stores, hospitals, pharmacies, petrol stations, telecoms and postal services and restaurants that deliver food.

"Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures," Delhi's Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal tweeted on Sunday.

Several districts, including the financial capital of Mumbai, have banned gatherings of four or more people, and officials can take legal action against those who violate the rule.

Numerous state governments have extended the "district-ban" to include their entire states. In the northern Indian state of Punjab, the chief minister announced that, except for essential services, the whole state will be under a lockdown until March 31. Punjab has confirmed more than 20 cases, including one death.

Uttarakhand, Rajasthan and Telangana have all initiated state-wide lockdowns versus targeted restrictions of cities and districts.

The central government advised the restrictions in 75 districts as these are places where coronavirus cases have been reported. Local governments can extend those restrictions to other areas at their discretion.

Maharashtra state, which includes Mumbai and Pune, has reported the most cases, with at least 67 infections, according to government figures. Kerala reported at least 52 cases and New Delhi has at least 26.

In the past few weeks, India has taken unprecedented steps to shut its borders, cancel visas and ban passengers from certain countries from entering Indian airspace.

On Sunday, India suspended passenger train services until March 31 after several travelers tested positive for coronavirus. India's mammoth railway network spans more than 760 million kilometers (472 million miles) and carried 8 billion passengers in 2018-19.

Asia spurred into action

The measures in India come as other Asian nations see jumps in cases and rush to implement emergency measures of their own.

On Sunday, Thailand reported 188 new novel coronavirus cases, its biggest single-day rise, bringing its total to 599. Thailand's Ministry of Public Health has announced new measures, which include the closure of dine-in restaurants, shopping malls and amusement parks.

Fears of a second surge in cases from patients traveling from overseas has prompted officials in China to divert all Beijing-bound international flights to other cities starting on Monday.

China confirmed 39 additional cases of coronavirus as of the end of day Sunday, according to the country's National Health Commission -- all were imported cases.

Singapore said it will shut its borders to all short-term visitors and travelers transiting though the city starting from Monday, according to its Health Ministry, which said the majority of its new infections were "imported cases."

On Monday, New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern announced new measures that "place the most significant restriction on New Zealanders' movements in modern history."

The country will issue its highest alert level in 48 hours and close all non-essential businesses across the country, such as bars, gyms, and cinemas. All schools will be closed from Tuesday while supermarkets and service stations will remain open, Ardern said.

Australia has also taken unprecedented measures in its response to the pandemic. Businesses across the country on Monday followed the government's orders to shut down bars, restaurants, gyms, places of worship and other venues where people traditionally congregate.

"Life is changing in Australia for every Australian and life is going to continue to change," Prime Minister Scott Morrison said. "For many young and old, 2020 will be the toughest year of our lives."

The state of South Australia declared a "major emergency" and shut its border with the rest of the country on Sunday after an increase in confirmed cases from travelers entering the state.

South Australia's Premier Steven Marshall said anyone entering South Australia "will be required to undertake 14 days of self-isolation."

The country's biggest state, New South Wales, will shut down all "non-essential services" in an attempt to slow the spread of the virus. The measures come after both Tasmania and the Northern Territory introduced similar measures requiring all travelers to self-isolate for 14-days upon entry into the state.

Olympics could be postponed

As sporting events across the world have been canceled, one of the biggest questions remains over whether the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympics will go ahead.

Speaking to lawmakers on Monday, Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said postponing the Olympics was a possibility.

The International Olympic Committee (IOC) said that a final decision on postponement will be made within four weeks, due to the vast complexities of rescheduling a massive global sporting event like the Olympics.

"The IOC's decision is along the lines of what I said before, of holding the event in its complete form. If that becomes difficult -- and thinking first about the health of the athletes -- we may have no option but to consider postponing the Games," Abe said, speaking at the budget committee in Japan's upper house of parliament.

It's the first time that Abe has changed his staunch public position that the Olympics will start on July 24 as scheduled.

In recent days, a growing number of countries and athletes have called for the Games to be postponed. On Monday, Canada announced that it wouldn't be sending athletes, making it the first country to back out of the Games.

"This is not solely about athlete health -- it is about public health," Team Canada said in a statement. "With Covid-19 and the associated risks, it is not safe for our athletes, and the health and safety of their families and the broader Canadian community for athletes to continue training towards these Games."

Australia's Olympic Committee has also told its athletes to prepare for the possibility that the Games could be postponed until 2021.

Scrapping the Olympics during peacetime would be unprecedented -- they have only been canceled before during the two World Wars. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
London (CNN) Imagine being stuck in traffic for 243 hours , equivalent to just over 10 days. Rush hour commuters in Bangalore, a city in southern India, spent around that time in traffic last year.

The city has the worst congestion in the world, according to the 2019 TomTom Traffic Index , overtaking Mumbai, which held the title for the previous two years.

Bangalore's rapid expansion as India's tech capital is partly responsible. The number of cars on the roads has rocketed from 1.4 million in 2000 to more than 8 million in 2019.

But tech could also provide the solution, as startups have sprung up to break the gridlock.

Take Bounce , a Bangalore-based scooter-hire company with a fleet of more than 17,000 electric and gasoline vehicles in its home city. Customers can rent a scooter via its app for as little as 14 rupees (19 cents) an hour.

Founded in 2014, Bounce now operates in more than 30 cities in India with both a docked and dockless model, where you can pick up or drop off the bike anywhere in the city. It claims more than 120,000 rides are taken on its scooters in Bangalore every day.

In January, the startup received a fresh $105 million in funding, taking its overall capital to more than $200 million, Varun Agni, its CTO and co-founder, tells CNN Business. This led to its latest public valuation of $500 million, he adds.

While the initial motivation behind Bounce was "democratizing the commute" and providing affordable access to mobility for all, one major byproduct has been a reduction in traffic, says Agni.

Four in 10 users start or end at a subway station, he says. "This has a massive impact on reducing traffic and congestion," as it encourages people to use public transport rather than using a car for the whole trip, he adds.

It also has an impact on the environment, especially as the company introduces more electric scooters to its fleet; by the end of the year, at least half of its vehicles will be electric, says Agni.

Cutting cars and carbon emissions

Quick Ride , a carpooling company also founded in Bangalore, aims to create a sustainable commuting option while cutting the number of vehicles on the roads, reducing fuel consumption and minimizing CO2 emissions, the company tells CNN Business.

It estimates it has saved 90,000 metric tons of CO2 emissions since its founding in 2015, equivalent to that emitted by 19,000 passenger vehicles in one year.

Using its app, drivers connect with passengers on the same route and fill their empty car seats. Quick Ride's system allows them to share the cost of the journey using fixed per-kilometer charges and it manages the payments through user accounts, removing the need for cash exchanges.

It operates in nine cities across India with a total of 3.5 million users, almost a third of which are based in Bangalore. The company says it has raised a total of $15.5 million in funding.

Heavy traffic in Bangalore.

Capgemini CAPMF Companies including consulting firmhave partnered with Quick Ride to encourage employees to carpool, as part of their corporate sustainability strategy.

More than 70% of employees signed up to Capgemini's #CAReToShare campaign in 2019, and since the start of the program in 2017 they have clocked up more than 33 million kilometers in carpool journeys, the company says.

"This program was launched with the dual objective of making the daily commute for our employees more convenient, while trying to ease the pollution plaguing our cities," Vijay Chandramohan, senior director of India's corporate real estate services for Capgemini, tells CNN Business.

"Cities in India are growing at an exponential rate," he says. "There is tremendous pressure on the city roads, leading to increasing traffic snarls and commute time resulting in frustration and loss of productivity."

Lucky the city's startups are on hand to help. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
London (CNN Business) India's government has been forced to rescue one of the country's biggest banks to shore up confidence in the financial system.

The Reserve Bank of India said Thursday that it had taken over Yes Bank, citing a "serious deterioration" in its financial position. The central bank said it had to act quickly to restore the confidence of Yes Bank's customers, who had been withdrawing their deposits.

Shares of Yes Bank, which describes itself as India's fourth largest private lender, collapsed following the announcement. The company's stock fell 56%.

The RBI announced a draft revival plan for Yes Bank on Friday that involves the government-owned State Bank of India — the country's biggest lender — taking a 49% stake.

In 2018, the RBI forced its founder Rana Kapoor to This isn't the first time India's central bankhas had to intervene at Yes Bank.In 2018, the RBI forced its founder Rana Kapoor to step down as CEO after 14 years at the helm. Kapoor was replaced by former Deutsche Bank India chief Ravneet Gill last year.

San Francisco (CNN Business) India's top court struck down a ban on cryptocurrency trading by the country's central bank, ending a nearly two-year legal battle to get the virtual currencies reinstated in the country.

The Supreme Court of India on Wednesday overturned a 2018 ruling by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), which prohibited Indian banks from dealing with cryptocurrency exchanges over "concerns of consumer protection, market integrity and money laundering, among others."

The central bank's ban came after months of scrutiny of digital currencies by financial regulators as well as the government, which compared them to "Ponzi schemes" and threatened to impose harsh regulations. The RBI gave Indian banks three months to sever ties with all entities dealing in virtual currencies.

The inability to use Indian banks for their operations crippled the country's exchanges that dealt in currencies such as bitcoin, ripple and ethereum, forcing many of them to shut down operations. Despite its population and online presence , India only accounted for around 3% of the global cryptocurrency market before the ban, according to estimates by crypto entrepreneur Sathvik Vishwanath.

But growing interest in virtual currencies meant there was "tremendous scope going forward," Vishwanath, cofounder and CEO of Indian cryptocurrency exchange Unocoin, told CNN two months before the ban. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
(CNN) Hours into Sunday's nationwide self-quarantine, people across India took a moment to join in solidarity and thank the nation's health care workers combating the novel coronavirus pandemic .

Following similar scenes days prior in Italy and Spain , Indians stood in their doorways and on balconies at 5 p.m. (8:30 a.m. ET) applauding, ringing bells and blowing conch shells, heeding Prime Minister Narendra Modi's call to express gratitude to those who have been on the front line.

An elderly couple bangs pans and cheers health care workers Sunday in New Delhi.

Modi proposed the 14-day quarantine during a national address Thursday, as coronavirus cases in India and across the world continued to rise. As of late Sunday local time, India had 376 coronavirus cases, seven of which have been fatal, according to Johns Hopkins University

The applause reverberated through the deserted streets of India. Indians of all ages joined celebrities, soldiers and politicians in thanking caregivers.

In the capital, New Delhi, President Ram Nath Kovind and senior ministers from Modi's Cabinet stood in their respective courtyards, expressing gratitude with a standing ovation.

About 20 miles southwest of the capital, in Gurugram, scores of residents in a massive apartment complex were clapping, blowing conch shells and ringing bells. Similar scenes unfolded in complexes across the nation.

In Jaipur, a city of 3 million about 160 miles southwest of New Delhi, two men blew conch shells from their balconies.

Their neighborhood was replete with sounds from different households, as residents joined in at the top of the hour to cheer on the country's emergency service personnel.

Soldiers from the Indian army, stationed throughout the country, also spent several minutes clapping to offer thanks, a tweet from the army's Eastern Command showed.

Bollywood celebrities expressed solidarity from their homes. Superstar Amitabh Bachchan and his family were seen on their terrace, acknowledging India's coronavirus warriors.

Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump began March with a barrage of false claims about the coronavirus pandemic -- understating the extent of the crisis, overstating the availability of tests, inaccurately blaming his predecessor and wrongly insisting that the crisis was unforeseen.

Trump made 50 false claims from March 2 through March 8, then 21 false claims from March 9 through March 15. Of those 71 false claims, 33 were related to the coronavirus . That is on top of some additional misleading claims from Trump about the coronavirus (we only count the false claims here), plus some false and misleading claims from members of his administration.

Trump is now averaging about 57 false claims per week since we started counting at CNN on July 8, 2019. From that date through March 15, he has made 2,062 false claims in all.

The most egregious false claim: The availability of coronavirus tests

On March 6, as doctors and health officials around the country were reporting a shortage of coronavirus tests, Trump said , "Anybody that wants a test can get a test. That's what the bottom line is."

In reality, Americans needed authorization from a doctor to get tested -- and even many people who did have a doctor's order could not get access.

This was Trump deceiving the country about one of the most critical problems of the crisis.

The most revealing false claim: Trade with Europe

Trump is serially reluctant to admit error, even trivial slips he makes while reading prepared speeches. Instead of correcting himself, he usually pretends that he has not slipped at all.

During his Oval Office address to the nation about the coronavirus on March 11, Trump, speaking from a script, announced that he was imposing restrictions on travel from Europe -- and then added that "these prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo, but various other things as we get approval. Anything coming from Europe to the United States is what we are discussing."

As he was forced to explain on Twitter after the speech, he was not actually banning trade and cargo from Europe.

So what happened? The usual, according to reporting from The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal . Trump's speech said the prohibitions would not apply to trade and cargo; Trump accidentally added the word "only," reversing the meaning; Trump plowed ahead as usual.

The most absurd false claim: Handshakes in India

Trump is regularly willing to make false claims that can be disproven using widely available video footage.

While meeting with the prime minister of Ireland on March 12, Trump was asked whether he was fine shaking hands with foreign prime ministers. Trump said they hadn't shaken hands that day -- then added, "You know, I just got back from India, and I didn't shake any hands there."

An Indian news website promptly published a photo gallery of seven Trump handshakes during his trip.

The coronavirus

'Control' of the coronavirus

"This is a very contagious -- this is a very contagious virus. It's incredible. But it's something that we have tremendous control of." -- March 15 coronavirus press conference

Facts First: Experts said the US did not have the virus even close to under control. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said at this same briefing after Trump left the room: "The worst is, yes, ahead for us. It is how we respond to that challenge that's going to determine what the ultimate end point is going to be. We have a very, very critical point now."

Trump claimed the next day that he had not meant the virus was under control -- that he had meant "we are doing a very good job within the confines of what we're dealing with." But he had repeatedly made clear on previous occasions that he was talking about the virus when he spoke of "control." He said in late January, soon after the US announced its first confirmed case, that "we have it totally under control." He said in late February, when the number of confirmed US cases was in the low dozens, that "we have it very much under control in this country."

Expectations of the pandemic

"...but we're having to fix a problem that, four weeks ago, nobody ever thought would be a problem." -- March 11 exchange with reporters at coronavirus meeting with bankers

Facts First: The US intelligence community, public health experts and officials in Trump's own administration had The US intelligence community, public health experts and officials in Trump's own administration had warned for years that the country was at risk from a pandemic. Some of the warnings specifically mentioned the possibility of a coronavirus pandemic. And when this particular coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, was identified in China in early January, health experts quickly cautioned it could be a major problem around the world.

"This was foreseeable, and foreseen, weeks and months ago, and only now is the White House coming out of denial and heading straight into saying it could not have been foreseen," Harvard University epidemiology professor Marc Lipsitch, director of Harvard's Center for Communicable Disease Dynamics, said on Sunday.

"Almost two months ago, experts were saying that the new virus in Wuhan was potentially a global threat," Lipsitch said in an email. "One month ago, experts were saying that it was likely to be pandemic, and the White House's response was that this was under control, despite the fact that the US's lack of testing was demonstrably giving a false picture of the extent of infection."

Obama and coronavirus testing

Trump claimed twice that he had reversed an Obama-era decision that had impeded testing for the coronavirus. On the first occasion, Trump said, "The Obama administration made a decision on testing that turned out to be very detrimental to what we're doing. And we undid that decision a few days ago so that the testing can take place in a much more accurate and rapid fashion. That was a decision we disagreed with."

Facts First: There is : There is no regulation from President Barack Obama that impeded coronavirus testing. The Obama administration did put forward a draft proposal related to lab testing, but it was never implemented. When asked what Obama administration decision Trump might be referring to, Peter Kyriacopoulos, chief policy officer at the Association of Public Health Laboratories, said: "We aren't sure what rule is being referenced."

Dr. Joshua Sharfstein, who was principal deputy commissioner of the FDA under Obama and is now professor of the practice at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health, said, "There wasn't a policy that was put into place that inhibited them. There was no Obama policy they were reversing."

The availability of coronavirus tests

"Anybody that wants a test can get a test. That's what the bottom line is." And: "Anybody right now and yesterday — anybody that needs a test gets a test. We — they're there. They have the tests. And the tests are beautiful. Anybody that needs a test gets a test." -- March 6 exchange with reporters after tour of the Centers for Disease Control of Prevention

Facts First: That simply wasn't true. There were an : That simply wasn't true. There were an insufficient number of tests available , as Vice President Mike Pence acknowledged the day prior, and Americans could not get tested simply because they wanted to get tested. "You may not get a test unless a doctor or public health official prescribes a test," Azar said the day after Trump's remark -- and even some of the people whose doctors wanted them to be tested were not able to obtain a test. (Azar claimed Trump was using "shorthand" for the fact that "we as regulators, or as those shipping the test, are not restricting who can get tested.")

Coronavirus testing

Trump was asked about a case in which a doctor in Houston reported being unable to obtain permission to get a patient tested despite the patient having "symptoms of something" and having tested negative for the flu.

Trump responded that this was a mere "one case" and that "frankly, the testing has been going very smooth." He also claimed: "If you go to the right agency, if you go to the right area, you get the test." -- March 12 exchange with reporters before meeting with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar

Facts First: It was simply not true that testing had been going smoothly or that, as Trump suggested, it was simple to get a test by contacting the proper authorities.

Health officials in states around the country continued to report a shortage of tests and other problems. Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Congress the same day: "The system does not -- is not really geared to what we need right now ... that is a failing. It is a failing, let's admit it."

Dr. Fauci said, "The idea of anybody getting it easily the way people in other countr(ies) are doing it: we're not set up for that. Do I think we should be? Yes. But we're not."

The timeline

"We got hit with the virus, really, three weeks ago, if you think about it, I guess. That's when we first started, really, to see, you know, some possible effects." -- March 5 Fox News town hall in Scranton, Pennsylvania

Facts First: The US had its first confirmed case of the coronavirus on January 21, more than six weeks before Trump spoke here, so it's not true that the US had not really seen even "some possible effects" until three weeks ago.

People's knowledge of the number of flu deaths

"You know, three, four weeks ago, I said, 'Well, how many people die a year from the flu?' And, in this country, I think last year was 36- or 37,000 people. And I'm saying, 'Wow, nobody knew that information.'" -- March 2 exchange with reporters at coronavirus meeting with pharmaceutical companies

"So when you lose 27,000 people a year, nobody knew that. I didn't know that." -- March 2 campaign rally in Charlotte, North Carolina

Facts First: Trump might not have known the number of annual flu deaths in the US, but that doesn't mean "nobody" else did. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention : Trump might not have known the number of annual flu deaths in the US, but that doesn't mean "nobody" else did. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention publishes annual estimates on its website.

The CDC estimates that between 12,000 and 61,000 people have died in the US in each flu season between 2010-2011 and 2018-2019; its preliminary figure for 2018-2019 is 34,157 deaths.

Flu deaths in 1990

Speaking about the flu, Trump said, "I think we went as high as 100,000 people died in 1990, if you can believe that." -- March 4 interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity

"...when I was hearing the amount of people that died with flu, I was shocked to hear it. Anywhere from 27,000 to 70,000 or 77,000. And I guess they said, in 1990, that was in particular very bad; it was higher than that." -- March 6 exchange with reporters after tour of the Centers for Disease Control of Prevention

Facts First: While the 1989-1990 flu season was considered bad at the time -- the CDC : While the 1989-1990 flu season was considered bad at the time -- the CDC declared that it was an epidemic -- Trump greatly overstated the number of deaths. A CDC analysis in 2010 estimated that there were 26,582 deaths from the seasonal flu in 1989-1990. (The same analysis found that this number of deaths was exceeded in nine of the 17 subsequent flu seasons through 2006-2007.)

Polling on Trump and the coronavirus

"Gallup just gave us the highest rating ever for the way we are handling the CoronaVirus situation." -- March 5 tweet

"Our response is one of the best, with fast action of border closings & a 78% Approval Rating, the highest on record." -- March 12 tweet

Facts First: Trump does not have a "78% approval rating" for his handling of the coronavirus, nor "the highest rating ever" for a president's handling of an outbreak.

Trump may have been wrongly describing a Gallup poll conducted in early-to-mid-February -- before there were any reported US deaths from the coronavirus -- that found 77% of respondents had confidence in the federal government to handle a coronavirus outbreak. But that poll asked about confidence in the government's future acts, not about approval of its actual work to date. It also did not ask about Trump in particular.

Polls actually asking about people's approval of Trump's handling of the virus situation at the time found that his approval rating is much lower than 78%. In an NBC/Wall Street Journal poll conducted March 11-13, 45% of registered voters approved of his handling of the coronavirus, while 51% disapproved. A Quinnipiac University poll conducted March 5-8 found that 43% of registered voters approved, 49% disapproved. (Some subsequent polls found Trump's coronavirus-related approval above 50%.) Conversely, a CNN poll taken in October and November 2009 found that 57% approved of Barack Obama's handling of the H1N1 flu pandemic.

Travel from Europe

"To keep new cases from entering our shores, we will be suspending all travel from Europe to the United States for the next 30 days...There will be exemptions for Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings...These restrictions will also not apply to the United Kingdom." -- March 11 Oval Office address to the nation on the coronavirus

Facts First: Trump was incorrectly describing his own policy.

His travel suspension did not apply to "all travel from Europe"; it applied to the 26 countries in the Schengen Area, a European zone in which people can move freely across internal borders. (Trump later added the United Kingdom and Ireland, which are not in the Schengen Area, to the restricted list.)

Trump did not mention that he was exempting a variety of non-US citizens, including permanent US residents and certain family members of both citizens and permanent residents. And by referring to "Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings," he did not make clear that US citizens can return from Europe even if they have not been screened before they take off for the US. The screening comes after they land in the US.

European goods

"There will be exemptions for Americans who have undergone appropriate screenings, and these prohibitions will not only apply to the tremendous amount of trade and cargo, but various other things as we get approval. Anything coming from Europe to the United States is what we are discussing." -- March 11 Oval Office address to the nation on the coronavirus

Facts First: Though he corrected his error in a : Though he corrected his error in a tweet shortly after his speech, Trump was not actually prohibiting trade and cargo from Europe. We're still counting this as a false claim because he did not correct himself during a high-profile national address.

The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal reported that, according to Times sources and a Journal review of drafts of Trump's speech, the text of Trump's speech said the restrictions will not apply to trade and cargo.

(Trump has a long history of attempting to improvise after he has made a mistake reading a speech from a Teleprompter, rather than simply correcting the error.)

A "rally" in Tampa

Talking about how his campaign has canceled rallies because of the coronavirus, Trump said, "And we had four or five of them that we were thinking about. We have a big one in Tampa, all sold out. We have over 100,000 requests for tickets, but I think we'll probably not do it because people would say it's better to not do." -- March 12 exchange with reporters before meeting with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar

Facts First: There was no "sold out" Trump rally in Tampa, Florida. While Trump's campaign was : There was no "sold out" Trump rally in Tampa, Florida. While Trump's campaign was in the process of planning a Tampa rally , the event had not been publicly announced and no tickets had been publicly offered, so it simply does not make sense that the event was "sold out" or that there had been "over 100,000 requests for tickets." The Associated Press reported that Trump's claim was "an impossibility" and that the campaign had declined to comment; the campaign also did not respond to our inquiry.

Google's coronavirus website

"I want to thank the people at Google and Google Communications because, as you know, they substantiated what I said on Friday. The head of Google, who's a great gentleman, said -- called us and he apologized. I don't know where the press got their fake news, but they got it someplace...And how that got out -- and I'm sure you'll apologize. But it would be great if we could really give the news correctly. It would be so, so wonderful." -- March 15 coronavirus press conference

"The Fake and Corrupt News never called Google. They said this was not true. Even in times such as these, they are not truthful. Watch for their apology, it won't happen. More importantly, thank you to Google!" -- March 15 tweet

Facts First: Google declined to comment on the substance of any call between CEO Sundar Pichai and the Trump team, but it's not true that the press did not call Google or that the press reported "fake news" about Trump's announcement that Google was helping to develop a coronavirus website, to be completed "very quickly," that would "determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location." Journalists contacted Google and accurately reported the company's initial response, which : Google declined to comment on the substance of any call between CEO Sundar Pichai and the Trump team, but it's not true that the press did not call Google or that the press reported "fake news" about Trump's announcement that Google was helping to develop a coronavirus website, to be completed "very quickly," that would "determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location." Journalists contacted Google and accurately reported the company's initial response, which made clear that Trump had exaggerated

After Trump made the announcement, Google issued a statement on behalf of its sister company Verily, which said , "We are developing a tool to help triage individuals for Covid-19 testing. Verily is in the early stages of development, and planning to roll testing out in the Bay Area, with the hope of expanding more broadly over time." In other words, there would be no quick national website. Verily's focus was one part of California, and the entity in charge of the effort was not Google itself (though Verily said Google engineers had volunteered to assist with the project).

Then, more than 24 hours after the initial statement from Verily, Google issued a second statement announcing that it would itself be "partnering with the US Government in developing a nationwide website that includes information about COVID-19 symptoms, risk and testing information."

So it was fair for Trump to applaud the second statement, but its existence does not mean that media reports about the first statement were inaccurate.

New York coronavirus deaths

"And then, when you do have a death, like you have had in the state of Washington, like you had one in California -- I believe you had one in New York..." -- March 4 interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity

Facts First: There had not been any New York deaths attributed to the coronavirus at the time. (The first two deaths in the state were : There had not been any New York deaths attributed to the coronavirus at the time. (The first two deaths in the state were announced on March 14, 10 days after Trump spoke here.)

The coronavirus situation in Italy

"...I hear the numbers are getting much better in Italy." -- March 6 exchange with reporters after tour of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

Facts First: The number of confirmed coronavirus cases and deaths in Italy was continuing to increase at the time Trump made this comment. As of Saturday, March 7, the day after Trump spoke here, Italy had 5,883 confirmed cases and 233 deaths; as of Monday, March 9, there were 9,172 cases and 463 deaths.

The coronavirus in the US and elsewhere

"We have very low numbers compared to major countries throughout the world. Our numbers are lower than just about anybody." -- March 6 exchange with reporters at signing of coronavirus appropriations bill

Facts First: Trump was exaggerating. The US did have fewer confirmed coronavirus cases than some countries, including China, Italy, Iran, South Korea, France and Germany. But it had more confirmed cases than big-population countries like India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Brazil, Russia and Nigeria, plus neighbors Mexico and Canada, plus many other high-income countries.

In addition, the number of confirmed cases is dependent on how many people are tested. The US was conducting fewer tests than some countries with much smaller populations.

A remark by Nancy Pelosi

"Nancy Pelosi just said, 'I don't know if we can be ready this week.' In other words, it's off to vacation for the Do Nothing Democrats. That's been the story with them for 1 1/2 years!" -- March 10 tweet

Facts First: Democrats were not going away on vacation, and Pelosi was not suggesting they were. Asked on Monday, March 9 if her goal was to have the House pass a coronavirus relief bill "this week," Pelosi : Democrats were not going away on vacation, and Pelosi was not suggesting they were. Asked on Monday, March 9 if her goal was to have the House pass a coronavirus relief bill "this week," Pelosi said , "I don't know that we can be ready this week, but we can introduce this week, we can introduce it and we may be ready this week, depending on CBO (Congressional Budget Office), depending on (the House Office of the Legislative Counsel) and how quickly they can get something back to us."

The House ended up passing the bill early in the morning of Saturday, March 14.

Canadians on the Grand Princess

Referring to the Grand Princess cruise ship that had been kept in limbo over coronavirus concerns before being allowed to dock in Oakland, Trump said on March 10, "So, the UK is taking their people, their citizens back, and Canada is about 600 people; they're coming back. They're being met and brought to planes and being brought very, very -- in a very, very dignified fashion back into Canada." He said on March 13, "We worked with Canada. They took their people back. And Canada has approximately 600 people..."

Facts First: Trump's number was wrong. There were fewer than 240 Canadians on the Grand Princess, according to the Canadian government; : Trump's number was wrong. There were fewer than 240 Canadians on the Grand Princess, according to the Canadian government; 228 Canadians were flown from California to a military base in Ontario on a plane chartered by the Canadian government.

People on the Grand Princess

Trump said, of the Grand Princess cruise ship that was being kept in limbo over coronavirus concerns, "We do have a situation where we have this massive ship with 5,000 people and we have to make a decision." He later amended the claim slightly, saying, "It's close to 5,000 people." -- March 6 exchange with reporters at signing of coronavirus appropriations bill

Facts First: Trump was overstating the number of passengers on the ship. There were : Trump was overstating the number of passengers on the ship. There were 3,533 people aboard : 2,422 guests and 1,111 crew members.

Trump's student loan plan

"Amazing how the Fake News never covers this. No Interest on Student Loans. The Dems are just talk!" -- March 15 tweet

Border closures

"In a certain way, you could say that the borders are automatically shut down, without having to say 'shut down.' I mean, they're, to a certain extent, automatically shut down. But it's affecting the airline business, as it would." And: "And we have closed down certain sections of the world, frankly, and they've sort of automatically closed them also." -- March 4 remarks at briefing with airline executives

Facts First: Trump did not explain what he meant by "the borders are automatically shut down." His travel restrictions at the time, on China and Iran, did not constitute complete closures of the border; they make : Trump did not explain what he meant by "the borders are automatically shut down." His travel restrictions at the time, on China and Iran, did not constitute complete closures of the border; they make exceptions for American citizens, permanent residents and some of their family members.

The Europe restrictions and testing

When a reporter noted that an American could bring back the coronavirus even with Trump's new travel restrictions on some European countries, Trump said, "Sure. But we have them very heavily tested. If an American is coming back or anybody is coming back, we're testing. We have a tremendous testing set up where people coming in have to be tested." -- March 12 exchange with reporters before meeting with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar

Facts First: It's not true that Americans or others returning from Europe "have to be" tested for the coronavirus -- and no system is being set up to actually test these returning travelers.

Instead, travelers are funneled to specific airports and put through an inspection known as enhanced screening, which cannot prove whether someone has the virus. Previous US airport screening for the coronavirus has involved temperature checks, questions about travelers' health and travel history, and an inspection for symptoms like a cough or breathing trouble. The administration's statements about the enhanced screening for travelers from Europe made no mention of coronavirus tests being conducted.

(Travelers returning from Europe after the restrictions went into effect faced lengthy delays while awaiting screening, and hundreds were packed shoulder to shoulder even as public health officials were advising Americans to keep a distance from other people. Chad Wolf, acting secretary of homeland security, later announced that they had "fixed" the problem with increasing staffing.

Handshakes in India

"You know, I just got back from India, and I didn't shake any hands there. And it was very easy because they go like this. (Takes slight bow.)" -- March 12 exchange with reporters before meeting with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar

Facts First: Trump was filmed shaking hands repeatedly in India, as Indian news website ThePrint pointed out. You can see images of his handshakes : Trump was filmed shaking hands repeatedly in India, as Indian news website ThePrint pointed out. You can see images of his handshakes here

Here is the full list of 71 false claims from the two-week period:

Obama, the coronavirus and swine flu

Trump said of H1N1, also known as swine flu: "And they didn't do anything about it." -- March 4 interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity

"If you go back and look at the swine flu and what happened with the swine flu, you'll see how many people died and how actually nothing was done for such a long period of time, as people were dying all over the place." -- March 12 exchange with reporters before meeting with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar

"And, interestingly, if you go back -- please -- if you go back to the swine flu, it was nothing like this. They didn't do testing like this. And actually, they lost approximately 14,000 people. And they didn't do the testing. They started thinking about testing when it was far too late." -- March 13 coronavirus press conference

Facts First: The Obama administration did respond to H1N1, and it's not true the administration did not even start "thinking" about testing until it was too late.

On April 26, 2009, less than two weeks after the first US cases of H1N1 were confirmed, the Obama administration declared a public health emergency. Two days later, the Obama administration made an initial $1.5 billion funding request to Congress. (Congress ultimately allocated $7.7 billion). That same day, April 28, a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention test was cleared for use. The CDC began shipping tests across the US and around the world on May 1. Between April 23 and May 31, the CDC says its influenza laboratory analyzed about 5,000 samples. In October, Obama declared a national emergency to allow hospitals more flexibility for a possible flood of H1N1 patients.

The Obama administration did face criticism over the pace of the government's vaccination effort, but "they didn't do anything" is clearly false.

Unemployment in Pennsylvania and Scranton

"This area of Pennsylvania, and Pennsylvania itself, has the best numbers it's ever had. It's got the best economy it's ever had. It has the best unemployment numbers it's ever had. And Scranton has the lowest and best unemployment numbers they've -- and employment numbers too -- that they've ever had, by far." -- March 5 Fox News town hall in Scranton, Pennsylvania

Facts First: Neither the unemployment rate for Pennsylvania nor the unemployment rate for the Scranton area is at its lowest level ever. And both rates have crept higher over the past several months.

The Pennsylvania state unemployment rate was at 4.5% in December 2019, worse than the best rates under presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. (The rate increased steadily in 2019 from the 3.8% rate in of April, May and June, which was the state's lowest rate since at least 1976.)

The December 2019 unemployment rate for the Scranton/Wilkes-Barre/Hazleton area was 5.6% -- worse than various rates under Clinton and Bush and also worse than the rate in Obama's last full month in office, 5.4% in December 2016. It hit 4.0% in April 2019, which was the lowest for the area since at least 1990.)

Social Security and Medicare

"I must say, that was a VERY boring debate. Biden lied when he said I want to cut Social Security and Medicare. That's what they ALL said 4 years ago, and nothing happened, in fact, I saved Social Security and Medicare. I will not be cutting, but they will. Be careful!" -- March 15 tweet

Facts First: Trump simply did not "save" Social Security and Medicare, which still face uncertain financial futures, and there is no evidence Democrats intend to cut either program. Also, Biden did not "lie" when he accused Trump of wanting to cut Social Security and Medicare: Trump's 2020 budget proposal includes : Trump simply did not "save" Social Security and Medicare, which still face uncertain financial futures, and there is no evidence Democrats intend to cut either program. Also, Biden did not "lie" when he accused Trump of wanting to cut Social Security and Medicare: Trump's 2020 budget proposal includes cuts to Medicare spending and spending on Social Security's Disability Insurance and Supplemental Security Income programs.

Trump's budget is a request to Congress, not a law, so the cuts may not happen. And Republicans are free to note that the proposed cuts would reduce projected future spending, but not be reductions from the current level of spending. Still, Biden had a reasonable factual basis for saying what he did.

(Trump also told Fox News earlier in March that "we'll be cutting" entitlement programs, though he did not say which ones. His press secretary claimed he was talking about "cutting deficits, NOT entitlements" when he said "we'll be cutting," though he had been asked, "But if you don't cut something in entitlements, you'll never really deal with the debt.")

Trade with Japan

"I just made a deal with Japan where they're paying $40 billion. They never gave us anything. All they do is sell us cars for no tax coming into the -- to the country." -- March 5 Fox News town hall in Scranton, Pennsylvania

Facts First: Japan does not export cars to the US for "no tax"; the US has a : Japan does not export cars to the US for "no tax"; the US has a 2.5% tariff on Japanese cars. It's obviously untrue that Japan "never gave us anything," whatever Trump meant by that vague phrase; Japan purchased $120.4 billion in US exports in 2018, according to government data . And experts say that the 2019 deal between the US and Japan does not include a $40 billion payment from Japan.

In prepared remarks in October, Trump himself said the deal "sets standards on the $40 billion in digital trade between the United States and Japan." In other words, he suggested himself that it contained provisions addressing $40 billion in trade, not that it was a $40 billion payment.

"Japan is not paying $40 billion dollars to the United States as part of the mini trade deal," Mireya Solis, director of the Center for East Asia Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution think tank, said in an email. She added: "US-Japan digital trade is worth $40 billion, but again that does not mean Japan is paying the US that amount."

Matthew Goodman, senior vice president and senior adviser for Asian economics at the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank, said there are "no hard numbers or commitments in the US-Japan deal to support that figure, as far as I know."

China and drugs

"When you go to a country where they have very, very stringent — unbelievably stringent, like probably we can't do in our country — they have no drug problem. You go into China, you say, 'How's your drug problem?' They don't even know — President Xi doesn't even know what you're talking about. 'We have no drug problem.' They have quick trials. Right? Quick trials. And I won't even tell you what the punishment is, but let me just say it's very swift." -- March 3 speech to the National Association of Counties Legislative Conference

Facts First: It is simply not true that China has no "drug problem," though Trump did not define what he meant by "drug problem." Joe Amon, director of global health at Drexel University and a clinical professor of community health and prevention, said the statement is "definitively" false. Ann Fordham, executive director of the International Drug Policy Consortium, a global network of non-governmental organizations, said, "There is so much data that refutes this claim from Trump."

Fordham noted that the US State Department released a report this very month that said China has a drug problem.In the report's words: "While drug trafficking, manufacturing, diversion, and other drug-related crimes remain significant problems in (China), the central government continues to take steps to integrate the PRC into regional and global drug control efforts, as well as to address the country's domestic drug problem through enforcement and rehabilitation." Amon noted that China's own official figures, as of 2017, listed about 2.5 million people registered as drug addicts. A 2016 report from the Brookings Institution noted that the number of registered addicts had "increased every year since the government's first annual drug enforcement report in 1998."

The New York Times reported in 2015 that it was widely acknowledged that the official numbers understated the extent of the problem. The Times reported : "In October, Liu Yuejin, director general of the government's anti-narcotics division, estimated the actual number of addicts at roughly 13 million."

Repeats

Here are the repeat false claims we have previously included in one of these roundups:

Ukraine and impeachment

The whistleblower

Trump called the whistleblower who complained about his dealings with Ukraine a "phony whistleblower" and claimed this person had described "a call that didn't exist." -- March 5 Fox News town hall in Scranton, Pennsylvania

Facts First: The whistleblower's account of Trump's July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been proven substantially accurate. In fact, the rough transcript Trump released showed that the whistleblower's three primary allegations about the call were correct or very close to correct. You can read a full fact check : The whistleblower's account of Trump's July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been proven substantially accurate. In fact, the rough transcript Trump released showed that the whistleblower's three primary allegations about the call were correct or very close to correct. You can read a full fact check here

Hunter Biden's career

Trump claimed that, before Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden's son Hunter Biden was appointed to the board of directors of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings, Hunter Biden "didn't have a job." -- March 5 Fox News town hall in Scranton, Pennsylvania

Facts First: At the time Hunter Biden was appointed to the board of Burisma in 2014, he was a : At the time Hunter Biden was appointed to the board of Burisma in 2014, he was a lawyer at the firm Boies Schiller Flexner, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University's foreign service program, chairman of the board of World Food Program USA, and chief executive officer and chairman of Rosemont Seneca Advisors, an investment advisory firm. He also served on other boards.

Before Joe Biden became vice president in 2009, Hunter Biden, who graduated from Yale Law School, worked as a lobbyist. He became a partner at a law and lobbying firm in 2001. (He stopped lobbying late in the 2008 election.) Before that, he had worked for financial services company MBNA, rising to senior vice president and worked for the US Commerce Department.

None of this is to say that Hunter Biden's name was not a factor in the Burisma appointment; Hunter Biden has acknowledged that he would "probably not" have been asked to be on the board if he were not a Biden. But Trump's repeat portrayal of him as an unemployed man is inaccurate.

Economy

Prescription drug prices

Trump claimed that last year was the "first time in 51 years that drug prices, prescription, have come down." -- March 2 exchange with reporters at meeting with Colombian President Iván Duque

Facts First: The decline -- shown in the Consumer Price Index, but not some other measures -- happened in 2018, not "last year." And Trump was exaggerating how long it had been since the 2018 decline; it had been 46 years, not 51. (This may seem like a small exaggeration, but it is habitual; he has made it more than a dozen times since July 8. You can read a longer fact check : The decline -- shown in the Consumer Price Index, but not some other measures -- happened in 2018, not "last year." And Trump was exaggerating how long it had been since the 2018 decline; it had been 46 years, not 51. (This may seem like a small exaggeration, but it is habitual; he has made it more than a dozen times since July 8. You can read a longer fact check here .)

Hispanic home ownership

"And we've increased Hispanic American home ownership by more than half a million homes. That's tremendous. We've seen the largest net gain in Hispanic American homeowners ever recorded." -- March 4 speech to Latino Coalition Legislative Summit

Facts First: The number of Hispanic homeowners had indeed increased by more than 500,000 during Trump's presidency, according to data provided by the National Association of Hispanic Real Estate Professionals -- it rose by 176,000 in 2017, 365,000 in 2018, 277,000 in 2019. But this total gain of 818,000 was not the largest net gain ever recorded. In 2001, 2002 and 2003, the first three years of George W. Bush's presidency, the total gain was 930,000, according to the association's data. (The net gain during the 2003-2005 period, also under Bush, was 940,000.)

Median household income and energy

"Median household income has hit the highest level ever recorded. If you look back and you go to President Bush, it's $450. If you go to President Obama -- and that's for eight years, remember. If you go to President Obama, for eight years, $975. And if you go to President Donald John Trump, over a period of three years, it's almost $10,000. That's a big difference." -- March 3 speech to the National Association of Counties Legislative Conference

Facts First: It's not true that median household income gains under Trump were almost $10,000 in three years. A firm called Sentier Research says real median household income, pre-tax, was $65,666 in December 2019 -- up from $61,496 (in inflation-adjusted December 2019 dollars) in January 2017, a difference of $4,170. Trump habitually adds an additional $5,000-plus on account of his loosening of regulations and supposed energy savings, but these explanations do not make sense mathematically.

Ivanka Trump and jobs

"We're also promoting workforce development through our Pledge to America's Workers. Four hundred and thirty companies have already committed to providing new jobs and training opportunities to over 15 million Americans. And I give my daughter, Ivanka, a lot of credit for that ... she started off with 500,000 jobs, and she just broke 15 million." -- March 3 speech to the National Association of Counties Legislative Conference

Facts First: Ivanka Trump has obviously not created more than "15 million jobs." Before the coronavirus crisis, roughly 7 million jobs had been created during the entire Trump presidency.

Trump was referring to the White House's Pledge to America's Workers initiative, in which Ivanka Trump has sought to get companies to commit to providing "education and training opportunities" for workers. As of March 19, 2020, companies had promised to create 15.7 million opportunities, including one million by Walmart alone -- but many of these opportunities are internal training programs, not new jobs. Also, as CNN has previously reported , many of the companies had already planned these opportunities before Ivanka Trump launched the initiative.

Unemployment

"Best unemployment numbers in the history of our Country." -- March 10 tweet

Facts First: Trump was exaggerating, though the February unemployment rate was indeed impressive.

The rate, 3.5%, was tied with September, November and December 2019 for the lowest since 1969. But it was not the best ever: it was substantially higher than the record 2.5% set in 1953 . (Unemployment is expected to worsen substantially in March as a result of the coronavirus crisis.)

Unemployment for women

Trump said women had the lowest unemployment rate "in 71 years."=- March 4 interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity

Facts First: This was another of Trump's : This was another of Trump's regular little exaggerations of an impressive accomplishment. It had been between 66 and 67 years, not "71 years," since the women's unemployment rate had been as low as it was in February, 3.4% ; it hit that level in late 1953. (It was also 3.4% during previous months of Trump's presidency, but we'll ignore those here for fairness to Trump.)

Unemployment rates are expected to rise substantially in March as a result of the coronavirus crisis

An LNG plant in Louisiana

"I opened up LNG plants in Louisiana where they were for years -- for 10, 12, 14 years and longer -- trying to get permits. They couldn't get permits. I got them built: a $10 billion plant in Louisiana..." -- March 5 Fox News town hall in Scranton, Pennsylvania

Facts First: The $10 billion LNG facility Trump visited in Louisiana in 2019 was : The $10 billion LNG facility Trump visited in Louisiana in 2019 was granted its key permits under Obama , and its construction also began under Obama. Federal regulators have approved other multi-billion-dollar LNG facilities for Louisiana under Trump, but they had not been waiting anywhere close to 10 or 14 years for approval.

The estate tax

Trump falsely claimed to have eliminated the estate tax. -- March 2 campaign rally in Charlotte, North Carolina

Facts First: Trump has not eliminated the federal estate tax. His 2017 tax law raised the threshold at which the tax must be paid, from $5.5 million to $11.2 million for an individual, but did not get rid of the tax entirely.

Foreign affairs

Venezuela's wealth

"The tragedy in Venezuela is a reminder that socialism and communism bring misery and heartache everywhere they're tried. I remember so many years ago -- 20, less -- it was the wealthiest country." -- March 4 speech to the Latino Coalition Legislative Summit

Facts First: Venezuela was not the wealthiest country in Latin America 20 years ago, as Trump has claimed previously, and certainly not one of the wealthiest countries in the world, as Trump has also claimed previously. (Trump didn't say this time which one he meant.)

"Venezuela was one of the richest countries in the world 60 years ago. The richest in Latin America 40 years ago. But not 20 years ago," Ricardo Hausmann, a former Venezuelan planning minister and central bank board member, said in response to a previous version of the claim.

Venezuela's per capita gross domestic product in 2000 ($4,824) was lower than that of Argentina ($8,387), Mexico ($7,016), Uruguay ($6,817) and Chile ($5,072).

The Mexican border

"We have, right now, 27,000 Mexican soldiers on our border." -- March 5 Fox News town hall in Scranton, Pennsylvania

Facts First: Mexico has deployed around 27,000 troops, but Trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the US border in particular; Mexico's defense minister : Mexico has deployed around 27,000 troops, but Trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the US border in particular; Mexico's defense minister said in October that it was about 15,000 on the US border, about 12,000 on Mexico's own southern border.

The Soviet Union and Afghanistan

Talking about the history of war in Afghanistan, Trump said the Soviet Union "became Russia because of Afghanistan. You know, it's a tough place." -- March 5 Fox News town hall in Scranton, Pennsylvania

Facts First: This was an exaggeration. Experts : This was an exaggeration. Experts say the Soviet Union's failed Afghanistan War was far from the only reason for its collapse, though the war did contribute.

Trump and the invasion of Iraq

"And I was always against Iraq -- going into Iraq. I think it was one of the worst -- maybe the worst decision ever made." -- March 5 Fox News town hall in Scranton, Pennsylvania

Facts First: Trump was tentatively supportive of the war in Iraq when radio host Howard Stern asked him in September 2002, "Are you for invading Iraq?" Trump responded: "Yeah, I guess so. I wish the first time it was done correctly." The day after the invasion in March 2003, he said, "It looks like a tremendous success from a military standpoint." Trump did not offer a definitive position on the looming war in a Fox News interview in January 2003, saying, "Either you attack or don't attack."

Trump started publicly questioning the war later in 2003, and he was an explicit opponent in 2004. You can read a full fact check here

Democrats

Democrats and cars

"If you like automobiles, how can you vote for a Democrat who all want to get rid of cars, as quickly as possible, especially if they are powered by gasoline. Remember also, no more than one car per family." -- March 10 tweet

Facts First: The Democrats are not proposing any limits on the number of cars a family could own. (Trump has previously claimed, falsely, that this one-car limit is included in the Democrats' Green New Deal environmental proposal.) And while some prominent Democrats, such as presidential candidate Joe Biden, want to implement policies they believe will reduce the number of cars on the road, they are not proposing to get rid of cars by any kind of government prohibition. Biden, for example, : The Democrats are not proposing any limits on the number of cars a family could own. (Trump has previously claimed, falsely, that this one-car limit is included in the Democrats' Green New Deal environmental proposal.) And while some prominent Democrats, such as presidential candidate Joe Biden, want to implement policies they believe will reduce the number of cars on the road, they are not proposing to get rid of cars by any kind of government prohibition. Biden, for example, argues that a major expansion of high-speed rail would result in millions fewer automobiles being driven.

The Green New Deal proposal calls for "overhauling transportation systems in the United States to remove pollution and greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector as much as is technologically feasible, including through investment in zero-emission vehicle infrastructure and manufacturing; clean, affordable, and accessible public transit; and high-speed rail."

Obama and Kim Jong Un

Trump discussed a conversation he claimed he had with President Barack Obama about North Korea and its leader Kim Jong Un. Trump said, "And I have a good relationship with him (Kim). I said (to Obama), 'Did you ever call him?' The answer is: Yes, he did. But I will tell you, I don't think they admit that; maybe they do. But called many times, and Kim Jong Un did not want to talk to him." -- March 5 Fox News town hall in Scranton, Pennsylvania

Facts First: There is no evidence that Obama called Kim even once. "This is a total fabrication," Susan Rice, who served as Obama's national security adviser, : There is no evidence that Obama called Kim even once. "This is a total fabrication," Susan Rice, who served as Obama's national security adviser, said on Twitter in response to a previous version of this Trump claim. "Obama never called Kim. Not once," Ben Rhodes, former deputy national security adviser to Obama, said on Twitter after this new claim on March 5. There's also no evidence for Trump's previous claim that Obama begged Kim for a meeting.

Obama and the 1994 crime bill

After touting the criminal justice reform bill he signed in 2018, Trump appeared to criticize the 1994 crime bill signed into law by President Bill Clinton and supported by then-senator Joe Biden -- and suggested Barack Obama, who was not yet in elected office of any kind, had something to do with it: "And, again, this was a Biden/Obama law that was -- this was -- and, obviously, it was -- it was really a Hillary -- this was a Bill Clinton and a Hillary. And it was -- I guess Biden was a senator then and pushing it hard. Obama was -- somebody said he was talking about it, but he had to be pretty young, if that were the case." -- March 4 interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity

Facts First: Trump seemed to realize partway through this claim that it did not make sense to blame Obama for a bill signed into law before Obama was even elected to the Illinois state Senate -- but even though he eventually conceded Obama was "pretty young" at the time, he did not make clear that Obama had nothing at all to do with the bill.

Accomplishments and promises

Veterans Choice

Trump twice claimed to have gotten the Veterans Choice health care program passed into law. On one occasion, he said others had tried to do so "for over 40 years." On the other, he said they had tried for "almost 50 years."

Facts First: The Veterans Choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by senators Bernie Sanders and the late John McCain, was signed into law by Barack Obama : The Veterans Choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by senators Bernie Sanders and the late John McCain, was signed into law by Barack Obama in 2014 . In 2018, Trump signed the VA Mission Act, which expanded and changed the program.

Overdose deaths

On separate occasions, Trump claimed that overdose deaths have declined for the first time "in 31 years" or "in nearly 31 years."

There was a rare decline in overdose deaths in 2018, according to preliminary data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics -- but it was the first in since 1990, or 28 years ago, not 31 or nearly 31 years ago.

Pre-existing conditions

"We are protecting people with pre-existing conditions and we always will." -- March 3 speech to the National Association of Counties Legislative Conference

"Pre-existing conditions: 100%, we take care of." -- March 5 Fox News town hall in Scranton, Pennsylvania

Facts First: The Trump administration has repeatedly supported The Trump administration has repeatedly supported bills that would weaken Obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions. Trump is currently supporting a Republican lawsuit that is seeking to declare all of Obamacare void. He has not issued a plan to reinstate the law's protections for people with pre-existing conditions if the suit succeeds, though he promised again at the town hall that Republicans would have one.

Air quality

"Nobody has done more in three years, the first three years, than we have. Now environmentally, we're -- we have the cleanest air. We have the cleanest water. Our air is as clean or cleaner than it's ever been." -- March 4 interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity

"And I say very simply: I want to have the cleanest air on the planet. I want to have the most crystal clear, beautiful water on the planet. And our conditions now are much better than they were three years ago." -- March 5 Fox News town hall in Scranton, Pennsylvania

Facts First: By several : By several measures , US air was cleaner under Obama than it has been under Trump. Three of the six types of pollutants identified by the Clean Air Act as toxic to human health were more prevalent in the air as of 2018 than they were before Trump took office, according to Environmental Protection Agency data. There were more "unhealthy air days" for sensitive groups in 2018 than in 2016, and researchers from Carnegie Mellon University who studied Environmental Protection Agency data found that air pollution increased between 2016 and 2018.

Trade and China

Chuck Schumer and the China deal

"Or I watch Schumer ... If you say, how great is the deal with China, oh, I don't like it, I don't like it. He said, 'He took away tariffs.' Well, I didn't take away the tariffs. They're paying 25 percent of $250 billion. They pay us a tariff of 25 percent on $250 billion. But he was screaming, he took away the tariffs. You know, he didn't want the tariffs. And then, all of a sudden, when he thinks they were taken away -- but we didn't take them away. Just the opposite." -- March 4 interview with Fox News' Sean Hannity

Facts First: Trump's deal with China reduces, though does not eliminate, some of the US tariffs on imported Chinese products. Schumer accurately described the tariff changes in a January : Trump's deal with China reduces, though does not eliminate, some of the US tariffs on imported Chinese products. Schumer accurately described the tariff changes in a January letter in which he argued that Trump had given away leverage "with a temporary deal of some reduced tariffs in exchange for American goods and vague promises of reform."

After Trump made a previous version of this accusation on January 15, Schumer responded the same day: "I know what's in the deal. I'm not sure the president does. If he knows what's in the deal -- he should throw it away and take China back to the negotiating table. I will cheer him on if he does."

China's agricultural spending

Trump said of Chinese agricultural purchases: "You know, the highest ever was $16 billion." -- March 3 speech to the National Association of Counties Legislative Conference

Facts First: Sixteen billion in Chinese agriculture purchases is not the record: China spent $25.9 billion on American agricultural products in 2012, according to figures from the Department of Agriculture.

Who's paying for Trump's tariffs on China

Trump claimed that revenue from his tariffs on imported Chinese products is "paid for by China" and that it is "money from China." -- March 3 speech to the National Association of Counties Legislative Conference

"China is paying us billions and billions of dollars because of what I did to them with tariffs. Billions of dollars." -- March 5 Fox News town hall in Scranton, Pennsylvania

Facts First: Study after study has shown that Americans are bearing the cost of the tariffs. And it is Americans who make the actual tariff payments.

The trade deficit with China

Trump claimed that the US used to have "$500 billion a year" trade deficits with China. -- March 3 speech to the National Association of Counties Legislative Conference

Facts First: There has never been a $500 billion trade deficit with China. (Trump describes trade deficits as "losing," though many economists dispute that characterization.) The 2018 deficit was : There has never been a $500 billion trade deficit with China. (Trump describes trade deficits as "losing," though many economists dispute that characterization.) The 2018 deficit was $381 billion when counting goods and services, $420 billion when counting goods alone.

Hillary Clinton and the trade agreement with South Korea

"We have successfully renegotiated new trade deals with South Korea and Japan, who were really ripping us. South Korea -- remember, Hillary Clinton -- the great Hillary Clinton -- she said, 'No, no we want this deal. It will produce 250,000 jobs.' And she was right, for South Korea. They produced -- (laughter) -- it's true. It got South Korea 250. So you can't say she was wrong. She wasn't misleading us. She said, '250,000.'" -- March 3 speech to the National Association of Counties Legislative Conference

Facts First: There is no record of Hillary Clinton projecting an increase of 250,000 jobs because of the United States-Korea Free Trade Agreement (KORUS). President Barack Obama said the deal would "support at least 70,000 American jobs."

Obama said in 2009 that increasing the US share of trade with Asia from 9% to 10% "could mean 250,000, 300,000 jobs," but he was not specifically attributing that estimate to the potential effects of a trade deal with South Korea. Republican Rep. Kevin Brady later used an estimate of "about 250,000 new jobs" from trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama combined, not just the one with South Korea.

The judiciary

Court vacancies

Talking about the federal judiciary, Trump said, "But the bottom line is, President Obama gave me 142 openings when I first got there." -- March 5 Fox News town hall in Scranton, Pennsylvania

Facts First: This is Trump's usual exaggerated figure. There were 104 court vacancies on January 1, 2017, 19 days before Trump took office, a : This is Trump's usual exaggerated figure. There were 104 court vacancies on January 1, 2017, 19 days before Trump took office, a ccording to Russell Wheeler , a visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who tracks judicial appointments.

The history of court vacancies

Trump claimed that "normally," presidents are left "no opening" on the federal judiciary; "if you have one, it's like you got lucky." -- March 5 Fox News town hall in Scranton, Pennsylvania

Facts First: It is standard for presidents to inherit dozens of vacancies. According to Wheeler, there were 53 vacancies on January 1, 2009, just before Obama took office; 80 vacancies on January 1, 2001, just before George W. Bush took office; 107 vacancies on January 1, 1993, just before Bill Clinton took office.

The legality of the Mueller investigation

"Many Republican Senators want me to Veto the FISA Bill until we find out what led to, and happened with, the illegal attempted 'coup' of the duly elected President of the United States, and others!" -- March 12 tweet

Facts First: The Russia investigation was not illegal. Multiple federal courts have : The Russia investigation was not illegal. Multiple federal courts have upheld the legality of special counsel Robert Mueller's appointment and endorsed actions he took, such as subpoenaing witnesses to testify before a grand jury and bringing criminal charges against some senior Trump aides. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

Follow her on Twitter @akankshamsingh . The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) For decades following World War II, the free world has looked to the United States for democratic and civil guidance. So, when President Trump wrapped up his two-day visit to India in February and praised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for India's "religious freedom" following Hindu-Muslim riots in parts of the capital, it didn't just feel like Indian democracy was crumbling further; it felt as though it had got the go ahead from a global superpower.

"We did talk about religious freedom, and I will say that the prime minister was incredible on what he told me," Trump said while announcing a $3 billion trade deal with India at a press conference in New Delhi on February 25. "[Modi] wants people to have religious freedom ... he said that in India they have worked very hard to have great and open religious freedom."

In reality, this religious freedom is under considerable threat, particularly for Muslims. The violence in New Delhi began over a disputed citizenship law on February 23, which led to clashes between Muslims and Hindus. The citizenship law, passed by the Indian government on December 11, 2019, grants fast-tracked citizenship to undocumented immigrants from Pakistan, Afghanistan, and Bangladesh based on their religion —provided they aren't Muslim. Critics of this law see it as unconstitutional for purposely leaving out a religious group. India, the world's largest democracy — where 80% of the population is Hindu, compared with 14% Muslim — has been secular since its birth in 1947.

So far, 52 people have died and more than 500 have been injured. The riots have also been accompanied by arson, stone-pelting, and larceny. The last time the city saw religious violence on this scale was during anti-Sikh riots in 1984, which followed the assassination of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi by her Sikh bodyguards.

This recent violence isn't just an isolated incident. It's part of a disturbing trend in Modi's India. Since the Modi-led Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) came into power 2014, there has been a rise in violent crimes against minorities . The violence has followed a rise in overtly religious nationalism in India's politics; several members of the BJP advocate for "Hindutva," a principle that aims to define Indian culture through Hindu values

So far, the US has declined to criticize the direction in which India is heading.

At his press conference in New Delhi, Trump declined to discuss the citizenship law, saying it was "really up to India" to handle. In describing Modi, Trump said he was a "very religious man" whom he admired and described India as "an incredible country. It's got unbelievable energy."

This isn't the first time Trump has shown his support for Modi. Last year, Trump featured at the "Howdy, Modi!" event held on September 22 , in Houston, Texas, attended by an estimated 50,000, many of them Indian Americans.

Trump's predecessor, President Barack Obama, also sought a warm relationship with Modi despite his record. Modi was, after all, the chief minister of the western state of Gujarat when Hindu-Muslim riots broke out under his watch in 2002. More than 1,000 people perished in those riots, most of whom were Muslim . The US State Department denied Modi a visa in 2005 over the issue. He has never apologized over what happened in Gujarat to date.

Given the divisive turn India has taken under Modi's leadership, Trump's support for Modi — offered, as it is, without much qualification and without any criticism — sends a dangerous signal that the US doesn't have any problems with his ethno-nationalist politics.

The New Delhi riots were — as some of my colleagues have pointed out — a pogrom. There is nothing to debate there, no matter what right-wing media mouthpieces in India say. Muslims were specifically singled out, their houses torched, their livelihoods destroyed, and their lives threatened — just like they had been, years before, when Modi was Gujarat's chief minister. Critics have leveled charges that police did not stop the violence, and the hatred for this minority has come from the uppermost levels of the BJP. "Shoot the traitors" has become a common cry at BJP rallies recently, after Anurag Thakur, the minister of state for finance, was seen leading a crowd with the inflammatory slogan in January. Unsurprisingly, perhaps, Modi did not condemn these comments either.

The only statement Modi made came nearly three days after the riots erupted in New Delhi — in the form of a tweet : "Peace and harmony are central to our ethos. I appeal to my sisters and brothers of Delhi to maintain peace and brotherhood at all times. It is important that there is calm and normalcy is restored at the earliest," he wrote, adding in a second tweet, "Had an extensive review on the situation prevailing in various parts of Delhi. Police and other agencies are working on the ground to ensure peace and normalcy."

The location in which the recent riots took place is small but significant. Muslims are being targeted by radical Hindus in the national capital, and violence has erupted without anyone in power taking decisive action to stop it. Since riots erupted, locals have accused police of standing idly by.

At present, the New Delhi police force is under the jurisdiction of the BJP-controlled Ministry of Home Affairs, not the AAP (Aam Aadmi Party), the opposition party that controls the local government in New Delhi. Before the riots, some Hindus flew saffron flags outside their shops and homes to stay safe in northeast New Delhi. A CNN reporter observed a saffron flag hoisted above a mosque.

We in India are still in the early phases of this terrifying regime, but if the world doesn't stand up and take notice soon, it will only get worse. India is very concerned about her image globally right now — it's the reason a wall was built to hide slums before Trump's visit.

In the months leading up to the US presidential election, it is imperative that Americans consider Trump's support of Modi. India is the world's second-largest country by population.

It's important for the president of the world's top superpower, as well as the candidates seeking to replace him, to condemn the ongoing hate crimes against Muslims as they unfold within the borders of an important ally and trading partner as it gains attention on the world stage. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Shillong, India (CNN) A retired employee of the Indian Air Force, Tej Gurung now spends his days at the archery shooting ground in the city of Shillong, in northeast India.

The 80-year-old grandfather goes there to play teer, the only legal form of gambling in Meghalaya state.

But this isn't like betting on a normal sport. Wagers in teer are based on the world of dreams.

The game works like this: Squatting in a semi-circle with their bows, 20 or so archers engage in a 10-minute firing frenzy, trying to hit a bundle of straw about 50 meters (164 feet) away from them as many times of possible.

Players bet on how many arrows will end up in the bale, choosing a number between 0 and 99 which represents the last two digits of the total number to find their mark. For example, if 453 arrows hit the bundle, everyone who chose 53 wins a payout.

It's a game of chance, but it is guided by the belief that the winning numbers appear in the dreams of players, who use a local system to translate images into numbers.

After each session, the arrows are counted to determine the winning numbers.

"A corpse, doctor and a person wearing a police uniform would all indicate the number 9," explains Loknath Khannal, a Nepali local who has been selling tickets at a Teer counter for 30 years. A dog or a cow would mean the number 4, he adds.

Gurung says he has been most lucky when being guided by his dreams, recalling a bet he placed on 12 after that number came to him in his sleep. He put on 5,000 rupees ($70) at various counters around town because most limited bets to 1,000 rupees ($14).

"I played a single number 12 on the first round and won," he said. "I don't remember how much I made in total, but for a 500 rupee bet, you win 40,000 rupees. So you can only estimate how much."

No one knows exactly how the ancient sport of archery evolved into a lottery, but it's so popular that people in neighboring states are dialing in bets and pocketing payouts.

Archers reclaim their arrows at the teer shooting ground in Shillong, India.

Archers earn a small fee

Teer, which means "arrow" in Hindi, has been around for about as long as the state of Meghalaya, which was carved out from Assam in 1972 and includes Khasi, Garo and Jaintia Hills, former kingdoms that came under British rule in the 19th century.

British colonial leaders once called the capital, Shillong, the "Scotland of the East," because of its wet climate, hilly topography and typical overcast gloom.

The state's three main indigenous tribes from these kingdoms were largely converted to Christianity by missionaries during British rule, making Meghalaya one of the few states in India that's predominantly Christian. Tourism and mining of mineral resources, such as coal and limestone, are the main drivers of the state economy. But Meghalaya still ranks among the lowest in India in terms of its Gross State Domestic Product (GSDP) and life expectancy, education levels and overall standard of living.

Gurung has been playing Teer for the past 40 years, but it has only been legal since 1982, when the Meghalaya government decided to lift it out of the shadows to make some tax revenue. Now, every ticket seller -- or counter operator -- pays a 10% cut to the government, on top of the archers' salaries and other operating costs.

Gamblers place bets on the last two digits of the number of arrows that hit the bale in the 10-minute period.

The archers, registered with one of the 12 neighborhood clubs in the Khasi Hills Archery Association, treat their earnings like extra cash since they are normally either formally employed or run a teer counter. Michael Shaibor, a 24-year-old archer who had been shooting for seven years, says he makes about 300 to 400 rupees ($4 to $5) a day, for about three hours work. "It's not bad," he says.

Bets come in five categories: single (0 to 9), house (10 to 19, 20 to 29), ending (last digit), and pair (11, 22, 33, 44) to the high-stakes forecast, which means guessing the exact numbers in both rounds on a single day. Players make their wagers at counters around town, which have varying limits for the jackpot.

Chandra Kumari, a Nepali local, says she occasionally plays for small sums of 10 or 20 rupees. Others spend a lot more.

"There are about 500 to 600 counters and an almost unlimited number of bookies in Shillong alone, where the bets can go up to Rs. 5 crores on a single day," said a bookie in Shillong, who asked not to be named as several bookies operate without a license.

Women in the game

Meghalaya is not only unique for allowing its citizens to legally gamble on Teer.

It's also the only Indian state where residents observe a system of matrilineal inheritance, an oddity in India's fiercely patriarchal society. Mothers pass their names and the family's property to their daughters. However, despite the elevated status of women in Meghalaya, and attempts to clean up teer's reputation as a pastime predominantly reserved for men, the game remains stubbornly male.

Women are a rare sight at the shooting ground, which has long been dominated by male archers and gamblers.

Philip Gean Khongsngi, president of the Khasi Hills Archery Association, says that before he took over in 2017, the archery ground in Shillong used to be a dingy den of men, who would often drink while gambling.

"About two years ago, we dismantled everything and propped up a cleaner space. But the taboo of gambling still remains," he says. The church expressly forbids any form of gambling, he adds, adding an extra layer of stigma.

Khongsngi says that while many women stay away from the shooting ground, many gamble in secret.

"Younger women, especially, would not go themselves to witness the game or even buy a ticket. For them, it's as taboo as going to a wine shop," Khongsngi says.

Sushma, one of the few female counter operators, who has been selling tickets for 16 years, says: "Women who go to church do play but are extremely secretive about it. They'll either send someone to buy a ticket or purchase it discretely so that no one sees them."

Lisa Wallang, who has sold tickets at the Shillong shooting ground since 2012, says: "Before me, my mother used to run a teer counter and that's how she supported her children. This is how I'm feeding my family and running my home now."

Gambling on teer used to be illegal but the law was changed in 1982.

Modern form of gambling

Last December, the Meghalaya government made an announcement that sent shockwaves through the Teer community.

It had decided to relaunch the state lottery, which stopped operating in 2005. Meghalaya is one among 13 states in India where the Supreme Court allows legal lotteries to be conducted as per an order in 2015.

"Re-introduction of state lottery will be the last nail into the coffin for Shillong Teer," one teer ticket seller told local media

While some bookies reportedly fear that the State Lottery could divert people's loose change away from Teer, others dismiss such apprehension. "Teer is like an addiction so people can't stop playing," said one Shillong-based bookie.

When the Indian government demonitized 500 rupee and 1,000 rupee notes overnight in November 2016, Teer -- like many small, cash-reliant businesses and cottage industries -- was badly hit.

Yet even demonitization did not deter locals from playing the game. "Those who used to play for Rs. 5000 came down to Rs. 500 a day," the bookie adds.

For many, Teer is more than a gamble: it's a way of keeping a connection to their roots, especially for those in the Jaintia Hills, many of whom have retained their indigenous religion, Niam Tre, or converted back to it from Christianity.

"Christian evangelists have tried to veer us away from this game, saying that gambling is a sin," says Pasah, who runs a teer ticket counter. "But for us, it is a way of keeping in touch with our own culture." <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
London (CNN Business) Disney is delaying the launch of its streaming service in India.

Disney+ was supposed to launch on March 29 to coincide with the start of the Indian Premier League (IPL) cricket season. But the season has been delayed at least until April 15 due to the outbreak of the novel coronavirus, and now Disney is revising its plans.

"Given the delay of the season, we have made the decision to briefly pause the roll-out of Disney+ and will announce a new revised premiere date for the service soon," Uday Shankar, president of Disney's Asia Pacific unit, said in a statement.

Global media companies have been racing to reach more Indian consumers, as millions come online for the first time.

21st Century Fox FOX Disney is planning to distribute its new service over Hotstar, a streaming platform that it bought fromin 2018. Disney revealed in April 2019 that the number of monthly active users on Hotstar had shot up to 300 million from 75 million at the end of 2017. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
New Delhi, India (CNN) Four men have been executed for the gang rape and murder of a 23-year-old student on a New Delhi bus in 2012, a case that shone a global spotlight on shocking rates of sexual assault in India .

Akshay Thakur, Mukesh Singh, Pawan Gupta and Vinay Sharma were hanged at a jail in the Indian capital on Friday, March 20, more than six years after being convicted of raping and killing the woman, known only as "Nirbhaya."

The four men were convicted in 2013 , but three of them appealed their death sentence to India's top court, the Supreme Court. All appeals were denied, including mercy pleas to India's President Ram Nath Kovind.

The case prompted outrage around the world and in India, where protesters demanded justice for Nirbhaya, a pseudonym given to the student that means "fearless." Under Indian law, victims of certain crimes cannot be named.

Campaigners called for tougher laws on sexual assault in a country where, based on official figures from 2018, the rape of a woman is reported every 16 minutes.

While reports of rape are all too common, the execution of prisoners for any type of crime in India is rare.

-- the highest number in nearly two decades -- In 2018, trial courts imposed 162 death sentences-- the highest number in nearly two decades -- according to data collated by National Law University in Delhi.

However, there were no recorded executions that year, according to Amnesty International. Only a handful of people have been executed over the past 20 years, including three terrorists, and Dhananjoy Chatterjee, who was executed in 2004 over the rape and murder of a school girl. Recently, the Supreme Court has commuted a number of death penalties to life imprisonment.

A horrific attack

At about 8:30 p.m. on December 16, 2012, Nirbhaya and her boyfriend took a chartered bus home after watching the film "Life of Pi" at a Delhi movie theater. It's common in India for chartered buses to pick up additional passengers during odd hours.

While the bus was moving, a group of men stole the pair's belongings, then took the victim to the back of the bus where they raped and assaulted Nirbhaya with iron rods, according to court documents. They also stripped and beat her boyfriend, who they held down during the attack.

Afterward, the men threw the naked victims from the front door of the moving bus and tried to run them over. They then cleaned the bus with the victims' clothes, before burning them and dividing the "loot" among themselves, including two mobile phones, a wrist watch, and a pair of shoes.

Nirbhaya died two weeks after the attack in a Singapore hospital, where doctors had been treating her for serious injuries to her body and brain. Before she died, she made statements to the authorities about the attack.

The men involved

Soon after the attack, police located six suspects, who knew each other before the incident.

The oldest was 34-year-old school bus driver Ram Singh, who "routinely" drove the vehicle where the attack took place, according to court documents.

He was accused of the victim's rape and murder but was never convicted as he allegedly killed himself in prison shortly after the trial began. His family claimed that he was murdered, according to media reports

The youngest, who was only 17 at the time of the attack and who cannot be named for legal reasons, was sentenced to three years in a juvenile correctional facility, and was released in 2015.

The other four, aged between 28 and 19 at the time of the attack, were convicted and sentenced to death less than a year later.

They include bus cleaner Akshay Thakur, part-time gym instructor Vinay Sharma, fruit seller Pawan Gupta, and Ram Singh's younger brother Mukesh Singh.

In a 2015 BBC interview, the younger Singh said "a decent girl won't roam around at nine o'clock at night. A girl is far more responsible for rape than a boy."

A wider issue of rape

In 2018, more than 33,000 cases of alleged rape were reported -- roughly 91 cases each day, according to India's National Crime Records Bureau.

The number of reported rapes has risen since 2012, potentially because of greater awareness and the perception that something will be done.

Legal reforms and more severe penalties for rape were introduced following Nirbhaya's death.

JUST WATCHED The women and girls of Delhi are fighting back. Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The women and girls of Delhi are fighting back. 02:03

Those included fast track courts to move rape cases through the justice system swiftly, an amended definition of rape to include anal and oral penetration, and the publication of new government guidelines intended to do away with the two-finger test which purportedly assessed whether a woman had sexual intercourse recently.

The authorities also updated the law to allow the death sentence for repeat rape offenders. Prior to that, the maximum punishment for rape was life imprisonment. In 2018, the law was amended so that the death penalty can be handed down in cases where the victim is a girl under the age of 12.

Experts say that the outrage following Nirbhaya's death has helped to lift the shame around discussing rape. However, many of the problems associated with India's rape crisis continue. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Vedika Sud is a CNN producer based in New Delhi. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own.

New Delhi, India (CNN) Seven years after her daughter was raped, a mother's battle for justice has finally been fulfilled.

For years, she fought to have the men who raped and murdered her daughter executed . On March 20,she got her wish.

But in India, where a rape of a woman is reported every 16 minutes, this is no time for celebration.

This case dates back to December 16, 2012, when a 23-year-old aspiring physiotherapist was gang raped by a group of men on a moving bus. The injuries were so grave that death, in her case, was painfully slow and inevitable.

The woman, who by Indian law can still not be named because she was a rape victim, died two weeks later in a Singapore hospital. The Indian media called her by the pseudonym, "Nirbhaya" -- in Hindi, "the fearless one."

The mother of Indian gangrape victim 'Nirbhaya' attends a rally held to protest the release of a juvenile rapist, in New Delhi on December 21, 2015.

The details of the case -- which include her being violated with iron rods -- are enough to make your skin crawl, but they explain why the case prompted such an emotional reaction. Never before had the country witnessed large scale protests against the government and police over a rape. For weeks after the attack, three words reverberated through the streets of India: "Hang the rapists."

Within a year of their incarceration, the four men convicted of Nirbhaya's rape and murder were sentenced to death. And in the months and years since, a debate has raged both in and outside India's parliament over how best to stop the country's persistent rape problem.

Since the attack, India has amended its rape laws, widening the definition to include anal and oral penetration. Gang rapists now face a possible life sentence, and repeat rape offenders can be handed the death penalty.

But these tougher laws haven't brought down the number of rapes. In fact, the number of rapes in 2018 -- the last year for which there are statistics -- was significantly higher than in 2012.

Opponents of the death penalty say the threat of execution does little to deter offenders, and does not address the societal problems that lead to sexual assault.

"It is very easy for the government to respond to these acts of brutal sexual violence with the death penalty. It's an easy solution, it sells well with the public," says Anup Surendranath, an expert in the death penalty at the National Law University, Delhi. "But it is no solution at all. I think everybody is clear that this is not going to prevent sexual violence or have any real impact on preventing sexual violence in the future."

Indian activists hold a candlelight vigil on December 30, 2013 after the death of Nirbhaya.

Opponents like Surendranath point to a chilling trend -- to avoid prison time, rapists are killing their victims to destroy the evidence and silence them.

Last year, for instance, a woman in Hyderabad was gang raped and then murdered . Her body then was burned to prevent identification. That same year, a rape survivor on her way to court to testify against the perpetrators was accosted and set on fire. She died a day later.

Some speculate that if rapists are willing to kill to avoid a jail term, they may be even more likely to kill to avoid the death penalty.

But there's a bigger argument against fighting violence with more violence.

Remember, sexual violence in India remains a complex social and cultural issue. This is arguably the biggest cause for crimes against women in the country. Justice is often only part of the remedy -- a huge responsibility also lies with the system and society.

The father of Indian gang rape victim 'Nirbhaya' addresses a rally in New Delhi on December 20, 2015, held to protest the release of a juvenile rapist.

According to activists, rape cases are still under reported -- victims are reluctant to come forward as they fear substandard investigations and the risk of intimidation by their alleged attacker if they lay a complaint. And even when cases get to court, most don't result in convictions -- in 2018, there were convictions in only 27.2% of cases. As Vrinda Grover, an advocate in India's Supreme Court, told CNN: "We have nothing in the name of witness victim protection, what is offered to women is a constable in front of her house."

If India really wants to change the dire rape statistics, it needs to address the chronic social disease: patriarchal attitudes.

In 2013, Dr Madhumita Pandey, an academic at Sheffield Hallam University in the United Kingdom, interviewed over 100 convicted rapists and murderers in India as part of her doctoral research. Her findings suggest a blatant lack of acceptance of responsibility by rapists for their actions, coupled with a sense of entitlement. The oft-repeated narrative she experienced while interviewing rapists was victim shaming.

Indian women board an overcrowded local train on July 10, 2014.

And, unfortunately, perpetrators of sexual violence are not isolated in their assumptions. In huge swathes of Indian society, especially in rural areas, women continue to be either objectified or confined to the four walls of their homes. Archaic gender norms limit them to baby making machines. "Subjugation of women -- combined with masculinity -- is bound to manifest in some extreme manner. In this case, it's sexual abuse and violence," Pandey told CNN.

As with anywhere in the world, justice will always be subjective. For Nirbhaya's mother, justice is death for the men who gang raped her daughter. For others, it ends with the incarceration of the convicts.

But justice will never mean the continuation of sexual violence against women. To stop that kind of injustice, India as a country must continue its introspection, understand why sexual violence arises, and bring it to an end.

Violence to end violence cannot be the solution. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Washington (CNN) By the time President Donald Trump landed from his trip to India early Wednesday morning, he was not happy.

On the way back to the White House, Trump decided it was time to take the reins himself: he would hold a news conference that evening, confident in his ability to bend the public narrative to his will.

Yet as the day went on, and plans for the news conference came together, uncertainty reigned.

By 4:30 pm, the jet-lagged President had only just come down to the Oval Office from the residence, and to the assembled officials who were there, it was still unclear what he intended to say at the news conference, which was just two hours away, said one senior Republican who was in the White House.

Earlier in the week, Trump had privately told allies he was close to taking the coronavirus response efforts out of the hands of Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, two sources familiar with the matter said.

Despite denials from the White House that he was considering replacing Azar with a "czar" to lead the federal response, when Trump stepped up to the lectern in the White House briefing room, that's effectively what he did by putting Vice President Mike Pence in charge.

The Pence decision was made shortly before the news conference and came as a shock to Azar, according to a senior Republican official. Pence, a frequent defender of Azar during his rocky relationship with the President, had agreed to step in, though there didn't appear to be much of a choice. Senior people who work for the vice president were caught by surprise by the announcement, according to one official who spoke to CNN.

For weeks, some of Trump's aides and allies have tried to impress upon him the seriousness of the coronavirus situation, warning him of the threat to the global economy and -- by proxy -- his reelection prospects, according to people familiar with the conversations.

Motivated by devastating losses on Wall Street, Trump finally decided to heed that advice. Yet it's unclear how much it helped.

His instincts led him to downplay the seriousness of the threat once again on Wednesday, undermining the predictions of his own top health officials standing behind him, and fueling concern over his administration's ability to coordinate a response to a complicated problem.

The financial fallout has also gotten worse.

The markets provided an initial verdict on Trump's performance Wednesday; Dow futures moved from positive to negative during the news conference. Markets opened deep in the red on Thursday. By the time the market closed that afternoon, the Dow had dropped an additional 1,191 points , bringing the total amount of wealth erased over the past week to more than $2 trillion.

Congressional Republicans who were already fretting over the White House response to the coronavirus were left scratching their heads.

One House Republican told CNN the falling stock market "was the only metric you needed to look at to see how poorly that was handled."

"We trust the President, but we really trust the President's experts. It would be a lot better if publicly they were more aligned," the member said.

Biggest governing challenge

Interviews with more than 20 sources across Washington -- including lawmakers, White House officials, health experts and diplomats -- paint a picture of deep concern over the widening coronavirus outbreak and the Trump administration's readiness to handle the crisis.

trump downplays coronavirus threat

As recently as last week, Trump was telling confidants that he doesn't foresee the virus making a big impact in the US. And on Wednesday he repeated his belief that it could be slowed by warmer weather, despite no evidence to support the claim.

Now the White House is confronting what some officials describe as the biggest governing challenge of Trump's presidency. Mindful that a botched response would spell potential political ruin, efforts have scaled up rapidly in the past several days, and one official said the response was nearing an all-consuming endeavor.

For the past month, there have been daily coronavirus meetings in the White House Situation Room. Yet it's unclear how effective they have been.

One person familiar with the discussions said the attendees at the meetings were often at a loss for how to solve the problems associated with the coronavirus, and for weeks were focused primarily on ways to prevent anyone infected or definitively exposed to the disease -- including American citizens -- from traveling to the US.

Officials have delivered topline numbers and broad-strokes information about the outbreak without delving into nitty-gritty specifics, a person familiar with the matter said, believing Trump to be uninterested in deeply detailed updates.

Some officials have blamed the cursory briefings for a breakdown in communication that has led to bursts of outrage by the President, who has complained he's been kept out of the loop on key decisions regarding potentially infected Americans returning to the US.

There is evidence things are improving. Speaking to CNN on Thursday, one government official working with the White House on its coronavirus response said, "There has been a sea of change since yesterday," noting that the situation had gone from zero communication to multiple conversations on Thursday.

This official noted that while the White House still didn't seem to have a full communications plan in place, it was reaching out to get an understanding of what was needed, including giving regular updates on travel.

State Department officials remain on edge, given how unpredictable Trump is and that he is a known germophobe, according to a source familiar with the situation. Some predict he will suddenly make a rash decision, such as barring incoming flights with people who could be infected.

Some US diplomats stationed overseas in countries where there are coronavirus cases are asking to come home, two sources say.

Pence effect

In this October 24, 2019, file photo, Vice President Mike Pence speaks at the Wilson Center's inaugural Frederic V. Malek Public Service Leadership lecture, in Washington.

Several people close to Pence fear that his appointment could spell political disaster for the vice president, putting him in an impossible position given health experts' warning that the virus will spread more in the US before the situation improves.

"Trump put Pence in because he thinks Pence will f--- it up," a Trump adviser said, describing some of the fears already being expressed by people close to the vice president.

But one GOP official noted Pence has credibility on Capitol Hill, a factor that could settle anxious lawmakers. "I think people trust Pence," the official said.

Another GOP official said Pence was a poor choice to lead the response, given his track record in Indiana with an HIV crisis . The source also said the President should've put someone with medical experience in charge.

It's unclear whether Pence, who has numerous campaign-related events in the coming weeks, will remain in Washington to coordinate or keep his campaign schedule.

On Thursday, Pence made a few additions to the Coronavirus Task Force, including economic adviser Larry Kudlow and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. He also appointed Deborah L. Birx as White House coronavirus response coordinator.

Birx, an American physician and diplomat who serves as ambassador-at-large and as US global AIDS coordinator, was appointed to her current job during the Obama administration. According to a source familiar with her situation, Birx was able to develop a close relationship with the Trump White House, in part because a Trump campaign official, Matt Mowers, became her chief of staff and remained in that role for almost two years.

Birx has overhauled the HIV strategy for the Trump administration, and in 2018 she and Pence developed a relationship when she spoke at the World AIDS Day event at the White House.

Birx did not ask for this job -- the White House came to her, sources said.

Continued economic impact

The animating fear for Trump will likely be the continued economic fallout from the coronavirus. The economy has slowed with each successive year of the President's term, as his tax cuts have failed to sparked sustained business investment and his trade war has inhibited it. That places the economic expansion at the mercy of consumers and their continued confidence.

The peril for Trump is that the coronavirus could yet tip the economy into recession. Mark Zandi, chief economist at Moody's Analytics, currently puts odds of a 2020 recession at even money but says it would become probable if the crisis swells to a global pandemic.

An American president has not sought reelection during a recession since Jimmy Carter in 1980. Carter lost in a landslide to Ronald Reagan.

Whether Trump understands the magnitude of that risk in unclear. If inveterate optimists on his team, like Kudlow, haven't warned him of that, one senior White House official expressed hope that outside voices can.

"Such warnings are on TV all the time," the senior official said, "so I imagine he's picked that up." <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

As a makeup artist, I get to witness first-hand how powerful and liberating cosmetics can be.

Whether I'm working on magazine covers, fashion campaigns, runway shows, editorials or weddings, I see every day how makeup allows people to control how they are perceived before they've even said a word.

I want to make a woman fall in love with her inner self and to channel her imagination and a sense of grit she may not always have immediate access to. This matters in our world, where older men in positions of power, have an outdated definition of beauty -- one that values being Barbie-pretty or fair-skinned, with light eyes and highlights in your hair.

Today, India has an increasingly global perspective on beauty and what beauty choices stand for. But there's still a lot of baggage from decades past.

India's colonial history influences how we perceive ourselves. There's something quite upsetting in how "white" we all want to look, in the popularity of fairness creams (especially in the south of India where people generally have darker skin) and in the use of light-colored contact lenses or blonde highlights.

Everyone wants what they don't naturally have. If you're brown, you might want lighter skin. If you're white, you might want to look tanned. If you have curly hair, you might want it straightened, and if you have straight hair, you might want it permed. Now I may not always agree with what women want to change about their appearances, but I respect their choices. I just hope they also can also attest to how much they love their natural beauty, including their skin tone, and that the requests aren't borne out of insecurities.

New technology has made it easier to embrace out natural skin tones. Thanks to better cameras, lighting, lenses and even Instagram filters, we now know more about how to play with light and shade to our advantage.

One of the reasons I started my YouTube channel in 2013 was because, at the time, there were none tailored to Indian women. I remember feeling apprehensive about discussing foundations or concealers until I had a corresponding shade available for my own skin tone.

Now, brands like Huda Beauty and Fenty Beauty have come out with thoughtful and inclusive varieties of darker shades. I'm proud to have helped launch some of Maybelline New York's new shades in India, and we now cater to an audience from across the spectrum -- from the palest alabaster skin to the deepest melanin-rich tones.

Despite these changes, there's something else holding us back from expanding our horizons: patriarchy.

There is a direct link between patriarchy and the freedom with which women can shape their own visual identities or control their own narratives. I find that women who are stronger -- those who come out, are able to do things and speak their minds -- are often from more progressive, privileged or matriarchal parts of India, like Kerala, where my mother was born. In areas where it is more patriarchal, it can be a different story with different aesthetics -- there's a more limited beauty vocabulary.

I've seen established male Bollywood actors dump unsolicited feedback onto their female counterparts -- mansplaining how their skirts aren't short enough or their hair not full enough. Women are expected to worry about fine lines and wrinkles, loss of hair, or changes in body weight. Female actors are constantly seen going under the knife, and for what? To just look prettier or younger, when the real health that matters -- mental and physical -- may well be crumbling on the inside.

There's no part of the female anatomy that the patriarchy has not distorted with its opinions. Yet, men themselves are often deeply uncomfortable when the tables are turned. I recently shot a story about men wearing makeup, with a young Bollywood actor who initially told me that he was cool with wearing makeup because he felt comfortable in his own skin. But to me, he seemed like a typical cis man who thinks concealer and smudged kohl is the limit of what is acceptable. It was almost as though eyeshadow was making him question his masculinity.

This sadly, is incredibly common in the Indian subcontinent. The root of the problem is a deeply engrained patriarchy that often burrows into our sensibilities from a young age.

Growing up, I was a fairly effeminate boy. I loved sitting and watching my mother brush her hair, put on makeup or dress up. My grandmother and aunts also always loved to get dressed and were well-groomed. I was fortunate enough to have lived this experience, and yet I'd still get told off when I wanted Barbies. I'd be told to get a He-Man instead. When I wanted to hang out with my female cousins or friends, I was told to go play cricket with the boys.

These gender stereotypes are a given in most Indian families. Those "boys wear blue, girls wear pink" ideas are still prevalent, and they filter down into people's beauty standards. Parents, for instance, will still cut young boys' hair as soon as people start saying he looks like a girl. It's unnecessary and an outdated level of control.

More significantly, this has a profound effect on one's sense of self. There were these photographs of me, taken when I was maybe 6 or 8 years old, where I was wearing my mother's big retro sunglasses, her scarf over my head and her huge heels, with a big purse hanging off my arm. My family later used it as a tool to poke fun at me in front of others. I used to feel so shy and humiliated -- because of the idea that "boys should be boys." I burned those pictures because I thought they should never see the light of day.

I didn't truly come to accept my inner self until my late twenties. But having traveled, lived and loved extensively, my mental canvas just grew so wide with possibility. One's capacity to love and respect others is directly related to one's capacity to love and respect oneself, through heartbreak, grief and shared experience. And to me, that's the real definition of beauty -- self-love, sharing and self-acceptance.

As told to CNN's Oscar Holland. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Washington (CNN) President Donald Trump made 115 false claims over the last two weeks of February, during which he faced a growing crisis over the coronavirus pandemic , visited India, held four campaign rallies and addressed the Conservative Political Action Conference.

Trump made 67 false claims from February 17 through February 23; that was the 11th-highest total of the 34 weeks we've fact checked at CNN. He added 48 false claims from February 24 through March 1; that week ranked 25th out of 34. As usual, many of the false claims were ones he has uttered before.

Trump made 55 of the 115 total false claims at the four rallies: 19 in Las Vegas, 17 in Phoenix, 10 in Colorado Springs and nine in North Charleston, South Carolina. He added 13 false claims in his speech to CPAC, nine in his press conference in New Delhi and six apiece at three events -- one of which was a press conference on the coronavirus.

As concerns about the possible economic impact of the virus mounted, Trump made 27 false claims about the economy. He made 16 about health care, 15 about trade, 14 about China.

Trump is now up to 1,990 false claims since July 8, when we started our counting at CNN. He is averaging about 59 false claims per week.

The most egregious false claim: "Russia, if you're listening"

Trump was at a press conference at his Doral resort in Florida in 2016 when he made his "Russia, if you're listening" request for help obtaining Hillary Clinton emails. The journalists in the room were silent as he spoke.

The fact that there is notorious video footage showing all this has not stopped Trump from making up an alternative history. He told CPAC on February 29 that he said "Russia, if you're listening" as "a joke," in front "25,000 people," and he was "laughing" afterward along with others in the crowd -- but the media cut off the clip "so quick at the end" so that people couldn't hear all of this laughing.

As we've explained before , Trump's version of the story is imaginary.

The most revealing false claim: The flu mortality rate

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health, told USA Today on February 17 that the mortality rate for the seasonal flu is "about 0.1%, 0.2% at the most."

On February 26, Fauci appeared with Trump at a White House press conference. There, another doctor, CNN chief medical correspondent Sanjay Gupta, told Trump that the flu has a mortality rate of 0.1%. Trump said, "Correct." But then, moments later, Trump said, "And the flu is higher than that. The flu is much higher than that."

It is not. Trump, though, has preferred during the coronavirus crisis to own the spotlight himself, while frequently providing inaccurate or incomplete information, rather than cede airtime to experts who could convey accurate information.

The most absurd false claim: Ronald Reagan's crowds

Trump's need to exaggerate the size of his crowds and to compare himself favorably to previous presidents combined to produce this doozy of a false claim, made during his rally in Las Vegas on February 21, about Ronald Reagan: "I thought he was a great guy, great president, didn't like his policy on trade, that's OK ... but if he came to Las Vegas, you know, they'd have a ballroom. They'd have 500, maybe a thousand people."

It took one Google search to find out that an estimated 7,000 people attended a Reagan rally at Las Vegas' convention center in 1982.

Here is the full list of 115 false claims, starting with the ones we haven't included in one of these roundups before:

Viruses

Awareness of Ebola in 2014

Comparing the coronavirus outbreak with the Ebola situation of 2014, Trump said, "At that time, nobody had ever even heard of Ebola." -- February 25 press conference in New Delhi, India

"Nobody knew anything about it. Nobody had ever heard of anything like this." -- February 26 coronavirus press conference

Facts First: Some Americans certainly didn't know a whole lot about Ebola before 2014, but the claims that "nobody" had ever even heard of Ebola and that "nobody" knew anything about it are absurd. Ebola was discovered : Some Americans certainly didn't know a whole lot about Ebola before 2014, but the claims that "nobody" had ever even heard of Ebola and that "nobody" knew anything about it are absurd. Ebola was discovered in 1976 . It had been the subject of considerable media coverage in the next three decades, not to mention scientific study.

Ebola mortality

On two occasions, Trump contrasted the fatality rate for the coronavirus with the fatality rate for the Ebola outbreak of 2014 to 2016, saying "in the other case (Ebola), it was a virtual hundred percent" and that "with Ebola -- we were talking about it before -- you disintegrated. If you got Ebola, that was it."

Facts First: While the Ebola outbreak of 2014 to 2016 certainly had a much higher death rate than the coronavirus, the Ebola rate was never "virtually 100%"; for the entire epidemic, it was : While the Ebola outbreak of 2014 to 2016 certainly had a much higher death rate than the coronavirus, the Ebola rate was never "virtually 100%"; for the entire epidemic, it was about 40% overall in the three African countries at the center of the situation. It was higher in the early stages of the outbreak, but it was never true that every infected person "disintegrated."

There were 28,616 "suspected, probable, and confirmed cases" in Guinea, Sierra Leone, and Liberia and 11,310 deaths, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

As of mid-September 2014, World Health Organization (WHO) researchers reported that there was an estimated fatality rate of 70.8%. But the rate "fell later in the epidemic with lessons learned in improving treatment," said Julie Fischer, associate research professor in the Department of Microbiology and Immunology at Georgetown University and director of the Elizabeth R. Griffin Program. Still, even at 70.8%, death was never guaranteed for infected people, as Trump suggested when he said "if you got Ebola, that was it."

"It was never 100%. That is just patently untrue," Fischer said.

The flu death rate

Gupta, CNN chief medical correspondent, told Trump at a press conference, "Mr. President, you talked about the flu and then in comparison to the coronavirus. The flu has a fatality ratio of about 0.1%." Trump said, "Correct." But Trump later disputed the figure, saying, "And the flu is higher than that. The flu is much higher than that." -- February 26 coronavirus press conference

Facts First: Even if Trump meant that the flu has a "much higher" fatality rate than 0.1% -- rather than meaning that the flu's mortality rate is "much higher" than that of the novel coronavirus -- he was wrong. The mortality rate for seasonal flu is "about 0.1%, 0.2% at the most," Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health -- who appeared with Trump at this same news conference -- : Even if Trump meant that the flu has a "much higher" fatality rate than 0.1% -- rather than meaning that the flu's mortality rate is "much higher" than that of the novel coronavirus -- he was wrong. The mortality rate for seasonal flu is "about 0.1%, 0.2% at the most," Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases at the National Institutes of Health -- who appeared with Trump at this same news conference -- told this to USA Today in mid-February, echoing the comments of other experts and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data since 2010

Apple and China

"And if you read, Tim Cook of Apple said that they are now in full operation again in China." And: "You probably saw that -- as I mentioned, Tim just came out and he said Apple is back to normal in terms of production in their facilities in China. They've made a lot of progress." -- February 29 coronavirus press conference

Facts First: Trump was overstating what Cook told Fox Business. Cook had not said Apple's production in China was "back to normal" or that plants in China were in "full operation." Rather, he : Trump was overstating what Cook told Fox Business. Cook had not said Apple's production in China was "back to normal" or that plants in China were in "full operation." Rather, he said that plants in China were "getting back to normal."

"When you look at the parts that are done in China, we have reopened factories, so the factories were able to work through the conditions to reopen. They're reopening. They're also in ramp, and so I think of this as sort of the third phase of getting back to normal. And we're in phase three of the ramp mode," Cook said.

Immigration

Who is paying for the border wall

Trump claimed that Mexico is paying for his border wall, saying, without explanation, "Yes, they are, actually. You know what I mean, right? They are paying for it." He added, "And they're OK with it because they understand that's fair."

Bernie Sanders and deportations

"Bernie said he'll never do a deportation. Right? Remember what he said? I better save this stuff. Maybe he won't get the nomination." -- February 29 speech at Conservative Political Action Conference

Facts First: Sanders has not said he will "never do a deportation." He is calling for a temporary deportation freeze, not a permanent ban. While he is also proposing a permanent end to deportations of undocumented immigrants who have been in the US for five or more years, this is just one portion of the undocumented population.

Sanders' immigration plan calls for a "moratorium on deportations until a thorough audit of past practices and policies is complete." (His campaign manager said in late February that the moratorium would not apply to "violent criminals." The plan also says he will use executive authority to allow undocumented immigrants "who have resided in the United States for five or more years to remain free from threat of deportation."

Crowds and rallies

The time of Trump's Las Vegas rally

Trump boasted about the size of the crowd at his rally in Las Vegas and said, "You know this thing was supposed to be for this evening and they said, 'Let me get back to Washington, do it early,' so we gave you almost no notice" -- February 21 campaign rally in Las Vegas, Nevada

Facts First: It's not true that people were given "almost no notice" for the time or date of Trump's rally at noon Las Vegas time on Friday, February 21. Noon was the time the campaign listed when it : It's not true that people were given "almost no notice" for the time or date of Trump's rally at noon Las Vegas time on Friday, February 21. Noon was the time the campaign listed when it announced the rally -- six days before the event was held.

Trump's 2015 rally in Phoenix

Trump said of Phoenix: "We won this state, and it was my first -- my first speech as a candidate, as you remember, in the convention center, and it was a tremendous success. So we -- I love this state ... Well, we came and we had 15,000 people, and it held a lot less...And that was actually my first speech as a potential candidate. So it was something very special." -- February 19 interview with Fox 10 Phoenix

Facts First: Though Trump did have a major rally at the Phoenix Convention Center in July 2015, it was not his first speech as a presidential candidate or as a potential candidate; he had launched his campaign nearly a month prior with a speech at Trump Tower in Manhattan, then : Though Trump did have a major rally at the Phoenix Convention Center in July 2015, it was not his first speech as a presidential candidate or as a potential candidate; he had launched his campaign nearly a month prior with a speech at Trump Tower in Manhattan, then held a rally in New Hampshire . And the crowd in Phoenix was smaller than "15,000"; the Phoenix Fire Department cut off attendance at 4,169, a spokesperson told PolitiFact in 2015 . (There is no evidence for Trump's 2015 claim that the convention center "broke the fire code by allowing 12-15,000 people in 4,000 code room.")

Trump was vague about what he meant by "we had 15,000 people"; he might perhaps have been referring to his campaign's claim that 15,000 tickets had been distributed. In the past, though, he has made clear he was talking about the size of the crowd in attendance. (Media reports said that hundreds of Trump supporters were outside the venue , but there is no evidence 11,000 were outside.)

President Ronald Reagan's crowds in Las Vegas

"There's never been this. You know, Ronald Reagan was great. I thought he was a great guy, great president, didn't like his policy on trade, that's OK ... but if he came to Las Vegas, you know, they'd have a ballroom. They'd have 500, maybe a thousand people." -- February 21 campaign rally in Las Vegas, Nevada

Facts First: About 7,000 people attended a Reagan rally at Las Vegas' convention center in 1982, according to a news : About 7,000 people attended a Reagan rally at Las Vegas' convention center in 1982, according to a news report at the time.

Russia, the Russia investigation and criminal justice

"Russia, if you're listening" and the media

"Remember this thing, 'Russia, if you're listening'? Remember, it was a big thing -- in front of 25,000 people. 'Russia if you're ...' It was all said in a joke. They cut it off right at the end so that you don't then see the laughter, the joke. And they said, 'He asked. He asked for help.' Right? 'Russia, if you're listening ...' A very famous -- they cut that thing so quick at the end because they didn't want to hear the laughter in the place and me laughing. It was just 'boom.'" -- February 29 speech at Conservative Political Action Conference

Facts First: Trump's story was comprehensively inaccurate. Trump did not make his famous 2016 "Russia, if you're listening" request -- for help obtaining deleted Hillary Clinton emails -- at an event with "25,000 people," nor did he laugh after he said it; he made the comment at a July 2016 news conference, with a straight face, and there was no audible laughter in the room. News outlets did not deceptively edit the footage.

Roger Stone and the Trump campaign

"Roger Stone, just so you know, never worked -- he didn't work for my campaign. There might've been a time -- way early, long before I announced -- where he was somehow involved a little bit. But he was not involved in our campaign at all." -- February 18 exchange with reporters before Air Force One departure

"Roger was never involved in the Trump campaign for president. He wasn't involved. I think early on, long before I announced, he may have done a little consulting work or something, but he was not involved when I ran for President. And he's a person who, again, he knows a lot of people having to do with politics. His whole life is politics. That's what he is." -- February 20 speech to Hope for Prisoners graduation ceremony

Facts First: Stone officially worked for the Trump campaign until August 2015, about a month and a half after Trump announced his candidacy, when the campaign announced he had been fired. (Stone : Stone officially worked for the Trump campaign until August 2015, about a month and a half after Trump announced his candidacy, when the campaign announced he had been fired. (Stone said he resigned . Regardless, he could not have been ousted if he had never been on the campaign in the first place.) Stone remained an informal adviser after that -- and communicated with top Trump campaign officials in 2016 about the activities of WikiLeaks, according to witness testimony and phone records presented at Stone's trial. Stone also communicated in 2016 with Trump himself.

The jury foreperson in the Roger Stone trial

Trump accused the foreperson of the jury in Roger Stone's trial of bias. He added, "And you know how they caught her? When he was convicted and then a statement was made, she started jumping up and down screaming, 'Yes, yes.'" -- February 21 campaign rally in Las Vegas, Nevada

Facts First: While Stone's legal team has also accused the foreperson of bias -- Judge Amy Berman Jackson held a hearing on Stone's request for a new trial and will issue a : While Stone's legal team has also accused the foreperson of bias -- Judge Amy Berman Jackson held a hearing on Stone's request for a new trial and will issue a decision -- it is not true that the foreperson jumped up and down screaming upon Stone's conviction or at any other point in the proceedings.

Stone's legal team challenged the juror on a tweet she issued, featuring hearts, fists and a link to a Facebook post that is no longer available, in the hours before the jury announced its guilty verdict on November 15, 2019. The foreperson said under questioning, "I don't know what this was in reference to" and that she was "absolutely not" celebrating the coming verdict. Regardless of what she meant, though, a tweet is not the same as a juror jumping up and down screaming in court as Trump suggested.

Navy sailor Kristian Saucier

Trump told the story of Navy sailor Kristian Saucier, who pleaded guilty in 2016 to one count of unauthorized possession and retention of national defense information after he took photos in 2009 of classified areas of the nuclear-powered attack submarine he worked on. (Trump pardoned Saucier in 2018.) Trump claimed: "And they had these pictures, and they put him in jail. He sent them to his mother and to his friend." Trump first said the photos were "considered classified," but, later in his comments, said that "what he did was, it was 'confidential.' 'Confidential' is a much lower class than 'classified.'" -- February 20 speech to Hope for Prisoners graduation ceremony

Facts First: Trump was minimizing the severity of Saucier's acts by falsely claiming that "confidential" is a "much lower class than classified." In fact, "confidential" material is classified; "confidential" is a : Trump was minimizing the severity of Saucier's acts by falsely claiming that "confidential" is a "much lower class than classified." In fact, "confidential" material is classified; "confidential" is a level of classification , not a separate, lesser thing. ("Confidential" is a lower level of classification than "secret" and "top secret," but prosecutors said it is "the highest level of classification of nuclear related equipment found aboard a nuclear submarine.") In addition, Saucier was not accused of sending the photos to his mother. The photos were discovered on a cell phone he had discarded in 2012 at a garbage dump in Connecticut; prosecutors said they later learned Saucier had shown them to someone he had served with and a woman he had lived with, and that his (former) wife had also seen them.

This was not a one-time slip about how classification levels work. Trump also told Fox News' Sean Hannity in 2019: "I remember he had confidential information which is a much, much lower standard than classified."

The FBI and "go get him"

Trump appeared to reference a report issued in 2019 by the Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz about Comey's conduct in releasing information from his memos about conversations he had with Trump in 2017. Trump said: "And if you would have read the report written about Comey -- 78 pages of kill, with a reference of 'Go get him.' They really said it: 'Go get him.'" -- February 20 speech to Hope for Prisoners graduation ceremony

Facts First: There is no mention of anyone saying the words "go get him" in this 2019 report. Nor do those words appear in Horowitz's 2018 : There is no mention of anyone saying the words "go get him" in this 2019 report. Nor do those words appear in Horowitz's 2018 report on actions taken by the FBI and Justice Department in advance of the 2016 election or Horowitz's 2019 report on aspects of the FBI's investigation into the Trump campaign and Russia.

Trump was vague here about what he was referring to when he invoked the phrase "go get him." But the best clue comes from a 2019 interview in which Trump claimed that former FBI official Peter Strzok meant "we're gonna go get him" -- go get Trump -- when Strzok texted colleague Lisa Page in 2016 about having "an insurance policy" for what Strzok saw as the unlikely event Trump would win the election against Hillary Clinton.

Strzok and Page have testified that the "insurance policy" meant that they needed to probe Trump and his team over their dealings with Russia so that, if anything nefarious was occurring and Trump did become president, the country could be protected. Trump and his allies argue that Strzok meant something more biased. Regardless, there is no evidence he said "go get him."

Democrats

Bloomberg's endorsers and campaign finance law

"What Mini Mike is doing is nothing less than a large scale illegal campaign contribution. He is 'spreading' money all over the place, only to have recipients of his cash payments, many former opponents, happily joining or supporting his campaign. Isn't that called a payoff? Mini is illegally buying the Democrat Nomination." -- February 18 tweet

"Is corrupt Bloomberg News going to say what a pathetic debater Mini Mike is, that he doesn't respect our great farmers, or that he has violated campaign finance laws at the highest and most sinister level with 'payoffs' all over the place?" -- February 19 tweet

"And there are a lot of campaign finance violations there. There's no way you can do what he's doing. You know, you go into a town, you give somebody a contribution, two days later the guy comes, 'I'd like to support Mini Mike Bloomberg.' There's something strange with that whole deal." -- February 29 speech at Conservative Political Action Conference

Facts First: There is no evidence that former Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg has broken campaign finance law either with his heavy campaign : There is no evidence that former Democratic presidential candidate Michael Bloomberg has broken campaign finance law either with his heavy campaign spending or by previously having donated to the political campaigns or favored causes of people who have now endorsed him. (We know of no cases in which someone endorsed Bloomberg this year "two days" after receiving some sort of contribution from him.) There is no legal limit on how much someone can spend on their own presidential campaign. It is also not illegal for someone who has benefited in the past from political or charitable contributions from someone to later endorse that person for office.

"So long as we are talking about campaign contributions within statutory limits made without an explicit promise to do or not do something, there is nothing illegal going on," said Richard Hasen, a professor of law and political science at the University of California, Irvine and an expert on elections law.

Chuck Schumer and Trump's deal with China

Trump claimed on three occasions that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer had falsely claimed Trump's "phase one" trade deal with China involved Trump taking off tariffs.

Facts First: Trump's deal with China reduces, but does not eliminate, some of the US tariffs on imported Chinese products. Schumer accurately described the tariff changes in a January : Trump's deal with China reduces, but does not eliminate, some of the US tariffs on imported Chinese products. Schumer accurately described the tariff changes in a January letter in which he argued that Trump had given away leverage "with a temporary deal of some reduced tariffs in exchange for American goods and vague promises of reform."

After Trump made a previous version of this accusation on January 15, Schumer responded the same day: "I know what's in the deal. I'm not sure the president does. If he knows what's in the deal -- he should throw it away and take China back to the negotiating table. I will cheer him on if he does."

Biden's debate claim about guns

"Sleepy Joe Biden also said that guns killed 150 million Americans last year..." -- March 1 tweet

Facts First: Biden did make a gaffe -- but Trump was inaccurately describing what Biden inaccurately said. Biden : Biden did make a gaffe -- but Trump was inaccurately describing what Biden inaccurately said. Biden said at the Democratic debate in Charleston, South Carolina, that 150 million people had been killed by guns since 2007, not that this many people had been killed "last year." (Biden's campaign said he had meant to say 150,000, which is roughly accurate.)

Hunter Biden

Trump claimed Hunter Biden, the son of Biden, "didn't have a job until his father became vice president." -- February 21 campaign rally in Las Vegas, Nevada

Facts First: Hunter Biden had several jobs before Joe Biden became vice president in 2009. Hunter Biden, a lawyer who graduated from Yale Law School, became a partner at a law and lobbying firm in 2001. (He stopped lobbying : Hunter Biden had several jobs before Joe Biden became vice president in 2009. Hunter Biden, a lawyer who graduated from Yale Law School, became a partner at a law and lobbying firm in 2001. (He stopped lobbying late in the 2008 campaign .) Before that, he had worked for financial services company MBNA, rising to senior vice president, and for the US Commerce Department. And President George W. Bush appointed him to the board of directors of Amtrak.)

At the time Hunter Biden was appointed to the board of Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma Holdings in 2014, he was a lawyer at the firm Boies Schiller Flexner, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University's foreign service program, chairman of the board of World Food Program USA, and chief executive officer and chairman of Rosemont Seneca Advisors, an investment advisory firm. He also served on other boards.

None of this is to say that Hunter Biden's name was not a factor in his career advancement. He has acknowledged that he would "probably not" have been asked to be on the Burisma board if he were not a Biden. But Trump's repeated portrayal of him as an unemployed man is inaccurate.

Tom Steyer's performance in New Hampshire

Trump mocked now-former Democratic presidential candidate Tom Steyer for his poor performance in Iowa and New Hampshire after spending heavily on his own campaign, saying, "He got one-third of 1% in Iowa. And in New Hampshire, he did much better. He got less than 3%." -- February 19 campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona

Facts First: Trump was correct about Steyer's : Trump was correct about Steyer's Iowa showing but understated Steyer's New Hampshire showing. Steyer got 3.6% of the vote in the New Hampshire primary, not "less than 3%."

Mark Kelly

Trump said of Mark Kelly, a Democratic Senate candidate in Arizona: "He wants to raise your taxes, open your borders, give away free health care to illegal immigrants, and he wants to obliterate your Second Amendment." -- February 19 campaign rally in Phoenix, Arizona

Facts First: Trump was misrepresenting Kelly's immigration positions.

While Kelly does oppose Trump's tax cuts for wealthy people, he does not support "open borders": "I'm not for open borders. I think we need border security. We also have to treat people fairly," Kelly said in response to Trump's comments at this rally. Kelly is also opposed to free health care for undocumented immigrants, saying in 2019 that the US is having a hard enough time providing health care for Americans.

The claim that Kelly would "obliterate" the Second Amendment is vague, but Kelly says he is the owner of multiple guns and supports the Second Amendment, though he wants "common sense" policy changes to keep people safer.

Kelly, a former astronaut and Navy pilot, is married to former congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords, who was shot and seriously wounded in 2011. Kelly has become a prominent advocate of universal background checks for gun purchasers. He also supports some other gun control measures, like "red flag" laws that allow guns to be temporarily taken from people deemed a danger to others or themselves.

Media coverage of Trump donating his salary

Trump talked about how he donates his presidential salary, then said, "I never had a story -- I don't think I've had a story that I give it. But I guarantee if I was ever late -- because it comes in quarterly -- if I was ever late, it would be a front-page story..." -- February 27 remarks in meeting with black leaders

Facts First: It's not even close to true that there has never been a story about Trump donating his salary. You can read some of the CNN stories about Trump's quarterly donations : It's not even close to true that there has never been a story about Trump donating his salary. You can read some of the CNN stories about Trump's quarterly donations here here , and here

California water rules

"Now that they're rationing water for people, they're saying you're going to get, very shortly -- I heard the governor saying you get 50 gallons. Fifty gallons sounds okay. People tell me it's like nothing. By the time you do with your showers, and your hands, and your tissues, and everything, 50 gallons is very, very little. Can you imagine a state being rationed, when you have millions and millions and millions of gallons being poured out into the Pacific Ocean that you could have? And you'd have more water than knew what to do with. It's crazy. Crazy. Crazy." -- February 19 remarks to rural stakeholders on California water accessibility

Facts First: California is not rationing water for people. Trump was mischaracterizing : California is not rationing water for people. Trump was mischaracterizing new state laws that set targets for water utilities but do not impose any limits on individuals or businesses.

In 2030 -- 10 years from now, not immediately -- the target for water utilities will be 50 gallons per capita of indoor water use for their customers. Water suppliers can be fined if they do not meet the target, but no individual person, household or company will face fines or cut-offs for using too much water. (The target system will come into effect in 2023 at a target of 55 gallons, then get more stringent.)

When Qasem Soleimani was killed

"So we took out Al-Baghdadi, and then, we just took out two weeks ago, the world's top terrorist Qasem Soleimani of Iran and his evil reign of terror forever." -- February 21 campaign rally in Las Vegas, Nevada

Facts First: Soleimani was killed on January 3, seven weeks before Trump spoke here. We might let this go if it were a one-time slip, but, intentionally or unintentionally, Trump has : Soleimani was killed on January 3, seven weeks before Trump spoke here. We might let this go if it were a one-time slip, but, intentionally or unintentionally, Trump has habitually moved the dates of his accomplishments much closer to the present.

A labor dispute in 2016

"Last time I had a strike in my building during the election. The only reason -- we would've won this state. Like brilliantly -- to save three cents. I could have settled the strike before the election. I wanted to save two dollars. Total. That was a brilliant move ... But we almost won the state despite I had a big strike." -- February 21 campaign rally in Las Vegas, Nevada

Facts First: There was a dispute between Trump and labor unions in Las Vegas during the 2016 election, and workers did picket his hotel, but there was not a strike; workers did not walk off the job, and Trump's company had not recognized the union in the first place.

The dispute centered around an effort by Trump's company, the Trump Organization, to fight a unionization effort by hotel employees; the company had refused to negotiate a collective agreement despite a worker vote to unionize. Though the workers protested, they did not cease working.

Trump's company settled the dispute after his election, agreeing to a four-year contract.

Waivers for military athletes

Trump touted his decision to give athletes from US military academies who have a chance to play professional sports the right to apply for a waiver allowing them to delay their active-duty service. He said, "They'd been after the waiver ... I did the rule and we got it through Congress and you don't have to serve. You go directly into the major leagues, into the NFL, and you serve your time after when you get out ... And we did it. They'd been trying to get that for so many years." -- February 20 campaign rally in Colorado Springs, Colorado

Facts First: The waiver policy was not achieved "through Congress"; it was created with a : The waiver policy was not achieved "through Congress"; it was created with a memo from Defense Secretary Mark Esper. And it's not true that people had been trying to get waivers allowed for "so many years"; a similar policy was put in place by the Obama administration in 2016, but Trump's first defense secretary, James Mattis, rescinded it in 2017.

The Muslim population of India

Trump said of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi: "And, as far as Muslims are concerned, as he told me, I guess they have ... 200 million Muslims in India. And a fairly short while ago, they had 14 million." -- February 25 press conference in New Delhi, India

Facts First: We can't know what Modi might have told Trump in private, but it's not true that there were 14 million Muslims in India at any point that can reasonably considered a "fairly short while ago." After the partition of British India in 1947, which created the modern states of India and Pakistan, the Muslim population that remained in India was : We can't know what Modi might have told Trump in private, but it's not true that there were 14 million Muslims in India at any point that can reasonably considered a "fairly short while ago." After the partition of British India in 1947, which created the modern states of India and Pakistan, the Muslim population that remained in India was about 35 million , noted Muqtedar Khan, professor of Islam and global affairs in the department of political science and international relations at the University of Delaware. When asked about Trump's claim, Christophe Jaffrelot, professor of Indian politics and sociology at the King's India Institute at King's College London, said it is "truly ridiculous!"

Trump's 200 million figure for the present Muslim population is about right.

The ratings of 'The Apprentice'

Trump claimed that "The Apprentice," his reality television show, steadily climbed in ratings all the way to the very top: "And then the show goes -- started at 10, went to eight, went to seven, went to five, went to four, went to two, it went to one. I had the number one show in all of television. Number one." -- February 21 campaign rally in Las Vegas, Nevada

Facts First: Trump had it backward: "The Apprentice" performed best in the ratings in its first season, then steadily declined. Trump has a : Trump had it backward: "The Apprentice" performed best in the ratings in its first season, then steadily declined. Trump has a long history of making the false claim that "The Apprentice" was the top-rated show on TV. (When he made this claim about "Celebrity Apprentice" at an event with television critics in January 2015, he was mocked by the critics on Twitter and greeted with laughter in the room -- eventually claiming , when challenged, that he had merely "heard" it was number one.)

Chicago Tribune culture journalist Steve Johnson wrote in 2016: "'The Apprentice' was a genuine hit in that first season, ending as the seventh-most-watched TV show of the year, averaging almost 21 million viewers a week," but "its ratings declined steadily each year after that, to 11th place overall in its second season, then 15th, then 38th. When, after its sixth season in 2007, it finished as the 75th-most-watched show (with 7.5 million viewers on average), NBC decided to scrap real people as contestants and bring on celebrities...The celebrity show did better, but it has been middle of the pack all the way, with finishes ranking from 46th to 84th before Trump announced his candidacy and NBC replaced him with Arnold Schwarzenegger."

There are various ways to slice and dice television ratings, so Trump might be able to point to some specific night, time slot, show category or viewer group in which "The Apprentice" was number one. But it certainly wasn't the top-rated show in all of TV, as he has long suggested.

Repeats

Here are the repeat false claims we have previously included in one of these roundups:

Economy

The estate tax

Trump claimed four times that he had eliminated the estate tax.

Facts First: Trump has not eliminated the federal estate tax. His 2017 tax law : Trump has not eliminated the federal estate tax. His 2017 tax law raised the threshold at which the tax must be paid, from $5.5 million to $11.2 million for an individual, but did not get rid of the tax entirely.

Apple and factories

Trump said of Apple: "...they're building plants. I just left one -- they just opened one in Texas; I just left it. And they're building another one, and a lot of things are happening."

Facts First: Trump : Trump did not visit a newly opened Apple plant in Texas; the facility he visited in Texas in November 2019, owned by Flex Ltd., had been making Apple's Mac Pro computers since 2013 . And there is no public indication that Apple is "building another one" in the United States.

It is perhaps possible that Trump was genuinely confused about the facility he visited in Texas, though he has made this claim before. Apple announced the same day of Trump's visit that it had broken ground on a new $1 billion campus in Austin. Trump accurately made reference to this campus in a tweet the morning after his visit.

The steel industry

Trump claimed that, before him, "The steel industry was dead. Absolutely dead in the United States."

Facts First: While some American steel companies were struggling before Trump took office and before he imposed his tariffs on steel imports in 2018, others : While some American steel companies were struggling before Trump took office and before he imposed his tariffs on steel imports in 2018, others were thriving . And Trump has regularly overstated how well American steel companies have done since his tariffs; the stock prices of major steelmakers, including Nucor, Steel Dynamics and US Steel, have fallen substantially since then.

Energy production

Trump claimed to have "ended the war on American energy," then said, "The US is now the number one producer of oil and natural gas in the entire world, by far."

Facts First: The US has not just "now" become the world's top energy producer: it took the top spot : The US has not just "now" become the world's top energy producer: it took the top spot in 2012 , according to the US government's Energy Information Administration -- under the very Obama administration Trump is accusing of perpetrating a "war" on the industry.

Wage growth

Trump said wages are rising for the "first time in 21 years."

Facts First: Wages have been : Wages have been rising since 2014, using one common measure.

Median usual weekly warnings went from $330 per week in the second quarter of 2014 to $349 per week in the fourth quarter of 2016.

The Dow's starting point under Trump

Trump touted gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average during his presidency, saying , "And we started off at 16,000..."

Facts First: The Dow didn't start the Trump era at 16,000 points -- whether you're looking at its level on Trump's first day in office or whether you go back to the day after his election, as he sometimes argues we should. The Dow opened and closed above 19,700 points on Trump's inauguration day in January 2017; the Dow opened above 18,300 the day after Trump's election in November 2016.

Women's unemployment

Trump claimed three times that the women's unemployment rate is the lowest in "71 years."

Facts First: It had been just over 66 years, not 71 years, since the women's unemployment rate was as low as it was in January 2020, : It had been just over 66 years, not 71 years, since the women's unemployment rate was as low as it was in January 2020, 3.5% ; it hit that level in late 1953. It was also 3.5% or 3.4% during previous months of Trump's presidency, but we'll ignore those for fairness to Trump.

The unemployment rate

Trump claimed three times that the unemployment rate is at its lowest level in "over 51 years."

Facts First: This was a very : This was a very small exaggeration , but an exaggeration nonetheless. (Trump habitually exaggerates even legitimate accomplishments.) The unemployment rate for January 2020, 3.6% , was the lowest since December 1969 if you don't count previous months under Trump when it was 3.5%. That is 50 years and one month prior, not "over 51 years."

Ivanka Trump and jobs

Trump claimed twice that Ivanka Trump is responsible for "15 million jobs" or more through the Pledge to America's Workers initiative.

Facts First: Ivanka Trump has obviously not created over 15 million jobs; at the time, roughly 7 million jobs had been created during the : Ivanka Trump has obviously not created over 15 million jobs; at the time, roughly 7 million jobs had been created during the entire Trump presidency . As of March 2, 2020, the Pledge website said companies had promised to create 15.7 million opportunities -- but many of these opportunities are internal training programs, not new jobs. Also, as CNN has previously reported, many of the companies had already planned these opportunities before Ivanka Trump launched the initiative.

The Waters of the United States and puddles

Trump claimed of the Obama-era Waters of the United States rule: "They took away their rights. If you had a puddle in the middle of your farm, they said it was a lake, it was a river, it was a -- I mean, they virtually said it was an ocean, right? You had no right; you couldn't get anywhere near it."

Facts First: Puddles were not covered by the Obama-era Waters of the United States environmental regulation; the rule explicitly : Puddles were not covered by the Obama-era Waters of the United States environmental regulation; the rule explicitly says puddles do not qualify as one of the waters in question.

Venezuela's wealth

Trump said : "Here's a case where a country was wealthy 15 years ago and very wealthy 20 years ago. Very, very wealthy. The wealthiest in all of Latin, South America. The wealthiest and -- by far. Not even a contest."

Facts First: Venezuela was not the wealthiest country in Latin America or South America either 15 or 20 years ago.

"Venezuela was one of the richest countries in the world 60 years ago. The richest in Latin America 40 years ago. But not 20 years ago," Ricardo Hausmann, a former Venezuelan planning minister and central bank board member, said in response to a previous version of this Trump claim. Hausmann, now a Harvard University professor, was chief economist of the Inter-American Development Bank from 1994 to 2000.

Venezuela's per capita gross domestic product in 2005 ($5,420) was lower than that of Mexico ($8,189) and Chile ($7,600), according to International Monetary Fund figures from 2019. Venezuela's per capita gross domestic product in 2000 ($4,824) was lower than that of Argentina ($8,387), Mexico ($7,016), Uruguay ($6,817) and Chile ($5,072).

Trade and China

Who is paying for Trump's tariffs on China

Trump claimed three times that the revenue from his tariffs on Chinese imports "came from China."

Facts First: Study after study has shown that Americans are bearing the vast majority of the cost of the tariffs. And it is Americans who make the actual tariff payments.

The trade deficit with China

On two separate occasions, Trump claimed that the US used to have a trade deficit with China of $500 billion or "more than $500 billion."

Facts First: The US has never had a $500 billion trade deficit with China.

China's peak agricultural spending

Trump said three times that China had never spent more than $16 billion on US agricultural products in a year.

Facts First: China spent $25.9 billion in 2012, according to figures from the Department of Agriculture.

The size of Trump's trade agreement with China

Trump claimed that his trade agreement with China was the "biggest trade deal ever made."

Facts First: It is not. Alan Deardorff, a University of Michigan professor of international economics who focuses on trade, said the China deal is smaller, in terms of the volume of trade covered, than both the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiated by the Obama administration and the Uruguay Round that created the World Trade Organization. You can read a longer fact check : It is not. Alan Deardorff, a University of Michigan professor of international economics who focuses on trade, said the China deal is smaller, in terms of the volume of trade covered, than both the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiated by the Obama administration and the Uruguay Round that created the World Trade Organization. You can read a longer fact check here

The US record at the World Trade Organization

Trump touted a recent US victory in a World Trade Organization case over illegal European subsidies to aerospace company Airbus, then claimed that, before he made it clear that he would withdraw from the WTO if the US was not treated more fairly, "We weren't winning anything." He added, "All of a sudden, we're winning all these cases."

Facts First: The US has long won cases at the World Trade Organization, and there is no evidence that WTO adjudicators have suddenly changed their behavior. Trump's own Council of Economic Advisers : The US has long won cases at the World Trade Organization, and there is no evidence that WTO adjudicators have suddenly changed their behavior. Trump's own Council of Economic Advisers said in a report in February 2018 that the US had won 86% of the cases it has brought since 1995. The global average was 84%. A Bloomberg Law review in March 2019 found that the US success rate in cases it brings to the WTO had increased very slightly since Trump took office, from 84.8% in 2016 to 85.4%.

The history of tariffs on China

Trump claimed that, prior to his tariffs on China, "we didn't get 10 cents forever from China."

Facts First: Again, Americans, not China, are paying most of the cost of Trump's tariffs. Aside from that, it's not true that the Treasury had never received "10 cents" from tariffs on China. FactCheck.org : Again, Americans, not China, are paying most of the cost of Trump's tariffs. Aside from that, it's not true that the Treasury had never received "10 cents" from tariffs on China. FactCheck.org reported that the US generated an "average of $12.3 billion in custom duties a year from 2007 to 2016, according to the U.S. International Trade Commission DataWeb."

China's economic performance

Trump said China had its worst economic year "in the last 67 years."

Facts First: China's officially : China's officially reported 2019 growth rate, 6.1%, was the lowest since 1990, 29 years prior . While China's official figures are unreliable, there is no basis for the "67 years" claim; Trump has habitually exaggerated how long it had been since China's growth was as slow as it was in 2019, steadily inflating the figure over time.

Health care

Pre-existing conditions

Trump claimed four times that he will always protect patients with pre-existing conditions.

Facts First: We don't usually fact check promises, but this one has already proved untrue. The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have repeatedly put forward bills and filed : We don't usually fact check promises, but this one has already proved untrue. The Trump administration and congressional Republicans have repeatedly put forward bills and filed lawsuits that would weaken Obamacare's protections for people with pre-existing conditions.

The Obamacare website

Trump claimed twice that the Obamacare website, Healthcare.gov, was so problem-plagued that it cost "$5 billion."

Facts First: The site did have major problems when it was : The site did have major problems when it was unveiled in 2013 , but "$5 billion" is an exaggeration. In May 2014, the Obama administration said the website cost $834 million. A September 2014 analysis by the information service Bloomberg Government, which looked at contracts related to the website, put the total at $2.1 billion.

Right to Try

On two separate occasions, Trump claimed that, before he signed a Right to Try bill in 2018, others had tried to get this done "for 44 years" and "for 51 years."

Facts First: There had not been a 44-year effort to get a federal Right to Try law, which aims to make it easier for terminally ill patients to access medications that have not been granted final approval. Trump signed the bill i : There had not been a 44-year effort to get a federal Right to Try law, which aims to make it easier for terminally ill patients to access medications that have not been granted final approval. Trump signed the bill i n 2018 ; similar laws have been passed at the state level only since 2014, after the Goldwater Institute, a libertarian think tank, began pushing for them.

Ukraine and impeachment

The whistleblower's accuracy

Trump claimed twice that the whistleblower who filed a complaint about his dealings with Ukraine was "fake," saying both times that the whistleblower's account of his July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was shown to be highly inaccurate when he released a (rough) transcript of the call.

Facts First: The whistleblower's account of the call has been proven largely accurate. In fact, the rough transcript Trump released showed that the whistleblower's three primary allegations about the call were correct or very close to correct. You can read a full fact check : The whistleblower's account of the call has been proven largely accurate. In fact, the rough transcript Trump released showed that the whistleblower's three primary allegations about the call were correct or very close to correct. You can read a full fact check here

The second whistleblower

Trump claimed that there was "supposed to be a second whistleblower," but "as soon as I released the transcripts, the second whistleblower was gone."

Facts First: The existence of a second whistleblower related to Trump's dealings with Ukraine was revealed : The existence of a second whistleblower related to Trump's dealings with Ukraine was revealed after , not before, Trump released the rough transcript of his July call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky; it's not true that this person vanished after he "released the call." In addition, the second whistleblower's lawyers had always said that this person never planned to file a separate whistleblower complaint, merely to offer corroborating information in private.

Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and the rough transcript

Trump claimed the transcript of the Zelensky call is "now 100% accurate, even according to Lieutenant Colonel Vindman."

Facts First: Vindman testified that two "substantive" changes he suggested to the rough transcript were not made, though also he said "I didn't see that as nefarious" and didn't see it as "that big a deal."

Popularity and accomplishments

Trump's approval with Republicans

Trump claimed that he has a "95% Approval Rating in the Republican Party, a Record."

Facts First: Though his approval rating with Republicans in some polls has crept up to around 95% -- he was at 93% with Republicans in the latest : Though his approval rating with Republicans in some polls has crept up to around 95% -- he was at 93% with Republicans in the latest Gallup poll , 94% in the Gallup poll before that -- that is not a record. George W. Bush hit 99% in Gallup polling after the 9/11 terrorist attacks of 2001, and his father, George H.W. Bush, hit 97% at the end of the Gulf War in 1991.

Trump's crowd in New Jersey

Trump claimed there were "tens of thousands of people" outside of his January rally in Wildwood, New Jersey.

Facts First: Trump was exaggerating. Ben Rose, director of marketing and public relations for the Greater Wildwoods Tourism Improvement and Development Authority, told CNN that the authority estimates there were between 3,000 and 3,500 people in the parking lot outside Trump's rally venue and between 2,000 and 2,500 people at a park across the street. Trump was given an inflated number during the rally by Rep. Jeff Van Drew, but nonetheless, it was wrong.

Empty seats

Trump claimed at two rallies that there has never been an empty seat at one of his events since he launched his campaign in 2015.

Facts First: There have been empty seats at various Trump rallies, including an October 2019 rally Minneapolis, a July 2019 rally in Greenville, North Carolina, an October 2018 rally in Houston and an April 2017 rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, according to journalists on the scene.

Presidents and handshakes

Trump told a story about how he shook the hand of every graduate in the Air Force Academy class to which he gave a commencement address in 2019 -- all "1,156 cadets." He said he was told by a general that other presidents did not shake every hand -- only 30, 40 or 50, or "the top 10 out of the class."

Facts First: There were : There were 989 graduates in the class Trump spoke to, not 1,156. And while we don't know what a general may or may not have told Trump, previous presidents have also shaken every hand at service academy graduations; contemporaneous news reports about Barack Obama and George W. Bush, for example, noted that they shook every hand at the graduations they attended.

Veterans Choice

Trump claimed five times to have been the one who got the Veterans Choice health care program created.

Facts First: The Veterans Choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by senators Bernie Sanders and the late John McCain, was signed into law by Barack Obama : The Veterans Choice bill, a bipartisan initiative led by senators Bernie Sanders and the late John McCain, was signed into law by Barack Obama in 2014 . In 2018, Trump signed the VA Mission Act, which expanded and changed the program.

Prescription drug prices

Trump claimed twice that "last year was the first year in 51 years where prescription drug prices went down."

Facts First: The decline -- shown in the Consumer Price Index, but not in some other measures -- happened in 2018, not "last year." And Trump was exaggerating how long it had been since the 2018 decline; it had been 46 years, not 51. You can read a longer fact check : The decline -- shown in the Consumer Price Index, but not in some other measures -- happened in 2018, not "last year."

Electoral votes in 2016

Trump claimed to have beaten Hillary Clinton in the Electoral College by a margin of "306 to 223."

Facts First: Clinton earned 232 electoral votes in 2016, not 223. This was not a one-time slip; Trump has habitually said 223.

Overdose deaths

At three rallies, Trump claimed that overdose deaths have declined "for the first time in nearly 31 years," "for the first time in nearly 32 years" and "for the first time in 34 years."

Facts First: This was another of Trump's : This was another of Trump's little exaggerations . The 2018 decline in overdose deaths was the first since 1990, 28 years prior.

People crying

Trump claimed that, at the event he held in 2017 to sign an executive order rolling back the Waters of the United States rule, "I had a lot of people -- a lot of farmers and construction workers and a lot of people behind me. And these are people that didn't cry when they were babies. They would -- never cried in their life, and they were crying."

The history of the President donating his salary

Trump said that "they don't think any other president" has ever donated his salary; he added that to "the best of our knowledge, we have not found another president that gave."

Facts First: Trump does donate his salary, but the rest of his claim was inaccurate. He is not the only president to have donated the official salary; both John F. Kennedy and Herbert Hoover did so.

Median household income

Trump claimed twice that median household income has increased by $10,000 during his presidency. On one of these occasions, he said it was "$10,000 a year."

Facts First: It's not true that there have been $10,000 in median household income gains under Trump, let alone "$10,000 a year." A firm called Sentier Research says real median household income, pre-tax, was $65,666 in December 2019, the last month for which Sentier has figures -- up from $61,496 in the month Trump was inaugurated, January 2017, a difference of $4,170. Trump is adding an additional $5,000-plus for reasons that do not make sense mathematically -- and $10,000 "a year" is simple nonsense.

Immigration

Democrats and borders

Trump said four times that the Democrats support "open borders."

Facts First: Even the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates who advocated the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as Massachusetts Sen. : Even the 2020 Democratic presidential candidates who advocated the decriminalization of the act of illegally entering the country, such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren , do not support completely unrestricted migration, as Trump suggests.

Mexican soldiers and the border

Trump claimed three times that Mexico has deployed "27,000 soldiers" to the US border.

Facts First: Mexico has deployed around 27,000 troops, but Trump exaggerated how many are being stationed near the US border in particular; Mexico's defense minister said in October that it was about 15,000 on the US border, about 12,000 on Mexico's own southern border.

Deportations to Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico

Trump claimed that Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador and Mexico used to refuse to accept back people the US wanted to deport, but now has stopped doing that. (Facts First: Trump was mixing up two separate issues. While the Trump administration does have new agreements with all four countries, those agreements are related to the handling of people who have come or are trying to come to the US seeking asylum, not criminals the US is seeking to deport. In 2016, prior to Trump's presidency, none of the four countries was on the list of countries that Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) considered "recalcitrant" (uncooperative) in accepting the return of their citizens from the US.

Democrats

Hillary Clinton's campaign spending

Trump claimed Hillary Clinton's 2016 campaign spent "at least three times more than we did" and spent "like $2 billion on negative ads."

Facts First: Clinton's campaign spent about $563 million total, not $2 billion on ads alone, according to the : Clinton's campaign spent about $563 million total, not $2 billion on ads alone, according to the Center for Responsive Politics , a money-in-politics watchdog group. If you add in spending by outside groups supportive of Clinton's candidacy, the total is still just under $770 million, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Clinton did outspend Trump, but by less than double, not "at least three times."

Obama and AIDS

Trump claimed he has "started" the process of ending the AIDS epidemic in America, then said the Obama administration "didn't start it."

Facts First: It's not even close to true that the Obama administration did not try to stop HIV/AIDS in the United States, experts say and budget data proves. The Obama administration spent more than $5.5 billion per year on the three primary domestic programs to combat HIV/AIDS, according to figures provided by the Kaiser Family Foundation, which closely tracks health care spending. Obama also introduced a comprehensive national strategy on combating HIV/AIDS. And experts note that the Affordable Care Act helped people with HIV gain health insurance coverage.

A quote from Rep. Al Green

Trump said Democratic Rep. Al Green had said, "We can't beat him, so we have to impeach him."

Facts First: Trump was at least slightly exaggerating Green's comments. In May, Green said this: "I'm concerned that if we don't impeach this President, he will get reelected." In September, when Trump previously claimed Green had said "we can't" beat Trump without impeachment, Green told CNN, "I never said we can't beat the President."

CNN

A story about Van Jones

Trump twice repeated a previous false story about CNN host Van Jones. He said Jones asked him to help with criminal justice reform, but then, after Trump signed a criminal justice reform bill, Jones then gave an address, televised on MSNBC, in which Jones thanked the Rev. Al Sharpton and others for the bill but never thanked Trump. (In one of the two new versions of the story, Trump said Jones had been "actually in tears" when he had asked Trump for help with justice reform.)

Facts First: Aside from the fact that Jones did seek Trump's help with criminal justice reform, Trump's story is fictional.

Jones is a CNN host who does not make speeches on MSNBC. Jones has habitually given Trump credit for the justice reform bill, and he says he has never given an address in which he has thanked Sharpton for it and not Trump. Jones also says he has never cried when speaking with Trump about criminal justice reform. ("100 percent fantasy," Jones said in a text message.)

Jones says Trump might have confused him with entertainer John Legend, who did participate in an MSNBC town hall on justice reform. You can read a full fact check here

CNN cameras

At two rallies, Trump referred to CNN as "fake news," then claimed that CNN turned off its camera at the rally immediately upon him doing so.

Facts First: CNN's photojournalists at Trump's rallies do not turn off their cameras when Trump criticizes CNN. Also, no CNN light suddenly went off as Trump criticized CNN in either of these cases: CNN's photojournalists at Trump rallies have the "tally" lights on their cameras set permanently to off. This false claim is a regular part of Trump's : CNN's photojournalists at Trump's rallies do not turn off their cameras when Trump criticizes CNN. Also, no CNN light suddenly went off as Trump criticized CNN in either of these cases: CNN's photojournalists at Trump rallies have the "tally" lights on their cameras set permanently to off. This false claim is a regular part of Trump's repertoire for rally speeches.

The Russia investigation

Robert Mueller's 2017 meeting with Trump

Trump claimed : "Even Mueller's statement to Congress that he did not see me to become the FBI Director (again), has been proven false."

Facts First: It has not been proven that Mueller had been seeking the job of FBI director when he met with Trump in May 2017. Mueller's testimony to Congress -- that he met with Trump because he had been asked to provide advice on the vacant job of FBI director, not because he was seeking the job again -- has been corroborated by former senior Trump aide Steve Bannon.

James Comey

Trump claimed to have "caught the dirty cop on top" of the FBI, former FBI director James Comey.

Facts First: We give Trump wide latitude to express opinions about public figures, but there is no evidence Comey was "dirty." The December : We give Trump wide latitude to express opinions about public figures, but there is no evidence Comey was "dirty." The December report from Justice Department Inspector General Michael Horowitz presented no evidence that Comey was corrupt in any way. Horowitz found significant errors in FBI work connected to the Russia investigation, and rejected Comey's claim of vindication, but he did not make any finding accusing Comey of deliberate malfeasance.

The legality of the Mueller investigation

On separate occasions, Trump claimed that "the whole Mueller investigation was illegally set up" and that it was "illegally started."

Facts First: The Mueller investigation was not illegal. Multiple federal courts have : The Mueller investigation was not illegal. Multiple federal courts have upheld the legality of Mueller's appointment and endorsed actions he took. Horowitz conducted an exhaustive review and determined in the report released in December that the FBI had a legitimate basis for opening the Russia investigation in July 2016, prior to Mueller's appointment in May 2017, though his report also criticized some FBI officials for how they had handled other aspects of the investigation.

Trump's past position on the war in Iraq

(CNN) — Every day, travel is growing increasingly restricted.

In Hong Kong, all arrivals must undergo a 14-day self-isolation at home followed by two weeks of medical surveillance. Canada is denying entry to anyone who isn't a citizen or permanent resident. And Germany has completely closed its borders.

As the world braces for the full impact of novel coronavirus, most of us are canceling trips, delaying face-to-face meetings and staying home as much as possible.

But not everyone has the luxury of postponing travel.

Many people -- pilots, cabin crew members and tour guides -- still need to travel in order to do their jobs.

We spoke with a few people in the industry to hear what life is like right now on the road and how they're coping.

Tarana Saxena, IndiGo pilot

Based in: Kolkata, India

"Due to the nature of my job as a commercial pilot, I have to travel all the time for work. My office is 35,000 feet above ground!

In the past two months, I have flown to Singapore, Malaysia, Vietnam and all over India.

My company is taking lots of precautions and so am I. I wear a mask, sanitize my hands and try to keep my distance from the ground crew and the public.

In the cockpit, we really bathe the place in sanitizer these days -- cleaning the instruments, seats, seat belts and everything before we settle in.

I also don't eat any plane food anymore or interact with the cabin crew as much since they are interacting with the public directly. Now, I pack my own food at home and bring drinks with me.

Whenever I arrive at a destination, the first thing I do is take a bath so I feel clean. No matter what time it is -- 2 a.m., 3 a.m., 4 a.m. ... now matter how late it is!

I used to explore cities during my layovers because I love to travel. But now I just stay in my hotel room.

Tarana Saxena, IndiGo pilot “Pilots don't have the option to call in sick or work from home.”

Since hotel prices have really dropped, I wish that I could take advantage of it and explore more on my days off. I'd love to take advantage of the lower rates. But it's just too risky.

In India, the virus is getting worse. Even in Mumbai and Delhi -- our most important cities for commerce -- everything is shutting down. Malls, colleges, schools, tourist destinations ... It is getting really bad.

The aviation industry is suffering too. All the flights are empty. I recently flew to Kolkata -- the flight had a capacity of 180 passengers, but we had only 36 people on board.

It has been a struggle. Pilots don't have the option to call in sick or work from home. And then there's the emotional side of it as well.

My family is so worried about me. I actually decided to stop telling them when I travel to places like China, Singapore or Malaysia.

They will beg me not to go, to take sick leave. Or they will message me every five minutes to make sure I'm OK.

But I can't just take leave, it's my job -- I need to be there. So now I just tell them I'm going somewhere like Bombay or Chennai, so they won't worry as much."

Shannon Stowell, CEO of Adventure Travel Trade Association, says he's had to change his primary mode of transportation. Lukasz Warzecha/Adventure Travel Trade Association

Based in: Greater Seattle, US

"As part of my job at the Adventure Travel Trade Association (a business community for adventure tourism companies and destinations), I spend a lot of time with our members, not only in their destinations but also at conferences and events to build up the adventure travel industry.

We have more than 1,300 members in 100 countries so I travel a lot! Normally, I travel at least once or twice per month for work, often to places like Brazil, Japan and India or within the US, like Colorado -- places with a big adventure travel sector.

When I first heard about the coronavirus outbreak (in China), I was in Brazil. At that time, the outbreak hadn't really affected the US so I continued traveling to events.

At first, I felt like it was blown out of proportion, that it was just another flu. My thinking has evolved since then -- it is more serious than I thought.

I was planning to go to ITB Berlin (the world's largest tourism trade event) in March, but after that was canceled, it triggered a lot of other cancellations in the industry.

Shannon Stowell, Adventure Travel Trade Association “At first, I felt like it was blown out of proportion, that it was just another flu. My thinking has evolved since then -- it is more serious than I thought. ”

Since then, I have been limiting my travel to only the most critical of business needs. I am still planning to go to one of our hot spots for adventure tourism, Colorado, later this month to meet with our stakeholders.

Instead of flying, I'm going to drive -- it's like a 22-hour road trip from the Seattle area where I live.

You can generally keep your distance when driving, so it feels safer than flying right now.

Even so, I will wash my hands, keep my distance, stay healthy, hit the Vitamin C hard and get some exercise. Exercise is an immune booster -- so just staying active is important to me.

I'm really excited about the drive. Oregon, Utah, Nevada ... It's such a beautiful part of the country. (My wife and I) will likely stop in small towns along the way, then go fishing, hiking and enjoy nature.

We're going to drive down Route 50, known as 'The Loneliest Road in America,' so I'm not expecting to run into other people!"

Rey*, flight attendant

Hong Kong-based flight attendant Rey says her hours have been significantly reduced. Courtesy Rey

Based in: Hong Kong

"I work as a flight attendant and travel for work. Most recently, I flew to Seattle where there weren't too many people wearing masks in public at all.

My family didn't want me to come by for dinner because they read the news all about the virus, so they wanted me to stay in my own apartment for a while.

We are taking so many precautions now -- wearing masks, disposable plastic gloves, normal glasses... we have to protect ourselves and the travelers.

I've noticed that passengers are becoming more cautious too. Most of them now wear masks, and some are even wearing full-face shields, helmets and goggles!

A lot of people are choosing not to eat on the flight, and fewer people are requesting blankets since many people just want to use their own belongings. I think they feel safer that way.

If I am operating a flight, I don't have to worry about getting stuck or quarantined, since my company will arrange everything for us.

Now in Hong Kong, if cabin crew members come back from the US or Europe, we will have to quarantine. But that is a new policy, so I didn't have to go through quarantine after Seattle.

The airline I work for is taking a lot of extra precautions. They are providing masks and gloves to staff to use while we are working and they're also modifying the inflight service. For instance, they are cutting down on some of the services to minimize the interactions with the guests.

Rey, flight attendant “Due to all the canceled flights, my workload has dropped off. I used to fly five to six flights per month but, more recently, I've only flown twice a month. ”

The airline has also stopped all flights to China, and they're encouraging staff to take unpaid leave.

Due to all the canceled flights, my workload has dropped off. I used to fly five to six flights per month but, more recently, I've only flown twice a month. Sometimes, I get informed that my flight has been canceled really early, other times at the last minute.

Since I am a full-time employee, I am still getting paid my salary but I have a reduced salary temporarily.

Now that I have more free time, I'm more devoted to my blog and Instagram which is all about travel and lifestyle.

I have been catching up on editing all my photos, videos and writing articles to share my experiences.

A lot of the airports have been really empty lately. I've heard from my colleagues that they have experienced a lot of racism when traveling.

When white people in the US saw Asian cabin crew members from Hong Kong in the airport, they shouted at them to get out of the country.

I used to love to explore on my layovers but now I can barely go anywhere as many places restrict Hongkongers from visiting."

Based in: Kyoto, Japan

"Working full-time as a tour leader in Japan , I conduct one-day tours in my home city of Kyoto and also longer group tours with about 14 people.

Usually lasting around two weeks, our group tours start in Tokyo then travel around the country to five or six destinations.

I just wrapped up our first 'Japan Unmasked' group tour of the year at the beginning of this month where we explored the old canals of Kurashiki, stayed in a Buddhist temple in Nagano, visited the traditional samurai and geisha districts of Kanazawa, and met ' snow monkeys' in Yudanaka.

All of our tour leaders have been following guidelines issued by the WHO and the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare. We wash our hands regularly and make use of alcohol-based hand sanitizer, which is being provided at most train stations, shops and restaurants.

Travel in Japan has remained largely unaffected. Public transport such as the subway, bullet trains and buses are all still operating as normal, so getting around isn't an issue.

Richard Farmer, tour leader “Travel in Japan has remained largely unaffected. Public transport such as the subway, bullet trains and buses are all still operating as normal, so getting around isn't an issue. ”

All restaurants, cafes and bars are also still open as usual, and although some establishments seem a bit quieter, the popular spots are still doing a roaring trade.

There's one shop in Kyoto that's famous for green tea tiramisu. I went past it on the bus earlier this week, and there was a line of at least 30 people waiting outside to sample their famous dessert!

Temples, shrines and gardens, which are the bread and butter of sightseeing in Japan -- especially in Kyoto -- are all open as normal.

Perhaps the biggest issue has been the fact that many museums, galleries and tourist destinations have closed, including the "art island" of Naoshima, Tokyo Disneyland and Universal Studios Osaka.

I'm trying to look on the bright side. The cherry blossoms will be in full bloom in Japan in just a couple of weeks. This would usually be one of the busiest seasons in Japan, with people flocking from all over the world to see the blooms.

Kyoto, especially, gets very crowded at this time. I'm looking forward to being able to go strolling under the blossoms in what I expect will be the quietest blossom season I've ever experienced! I hope as many of our customers as possible continue with their travel plans and can experience this beautiful time of year.

On my most recent tour, I couldn't believe how wonderfully quiet things were everywhere we traveled.

Particularly in Kyoto, which has been on the verge of overtourism in recent years, I had a delightful time with my group at Fushimi Inari Shrine in the south of Kyoto. The place was almost deserted -- I haven't seen it that quiet since I first visited 13 years ago!" <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) — Home to more than 1.2 billion people , India is a kaleidoscope of diverse languages, beliefs and religious practices.

The country has at least nine recognized religions, including Islam, Buddhism, Christianity, Sikhism, Jainism and several tribal and folk beliefs.

The majority of people in India practice one of two faiths: 80% of people identify as Hindu, while 14% identify as Muslim, according to the most recent census . But the mix of faiths fluctuates wildly depending on the region.

For example, a large concentration of Buddhists can be found in the western state of Maharashtra, where Mumbai is located, while northerly Punjab is home to the lion's share of India's Sikh population.

Reflecting the country's religious diversity, elaborate and imposing temples can be found across the country -- some date back centuries, others are modern architectural marvels.

Here are eight of the most beautiful temples when you travel to India:

Vaishno Devi Temple

It takes a bit of work to get to India's stunning Vaishno Devi Temple. Ministry of Tourism, Government of India

Where: Katra, Indian-controlled Kashmir

Set about 5,300 feet above sea level in northern India, Vaishno Devi Temple draws roughly 8 million pilgrims every year to the Holy Cave of the Mother.

Most commonly accessed on foot via a 12-kilometer trail, the journey takes about six hours for a reasonably fit person. Since it's mostly uphill, there are several places to eat, rest or stay overnight along the way.

The elderly, ill or injured can request to be carried up the hill on a palanquin. Alternatively, it's possible to make the journey on horseback or even take a helicopter.

Once there, visitors are surrounded by dense forests and mountains. The scenery will either glisten with dewy shades of green or glow under a white blanket of snow, depending on the time of visit.

From the main temple, there's a cable car that leads to Bhairav Baba, a holy temple about 1.5 kilometers up the mountainside.

Golden Gurdwara (Golden Temple)

Where: Amritsar, Punjab

A famed Sikh temple in northern India, the Golden Temple gets its name from its gilded facade, which is said to be covered in pure gold leaf.

The 16th-century temple is considered the central place of worship of the Sikh religion. As such, it's common for devotees to make the pilgrimage at least once in a lifetime.

It's nothing short of a work of art. Inside, visitors will find colorful paintings and intricate tiled mosaics -- all representative of Mughal-style architecture.

The temple is famous another reason: its Langar, a communal kitchen that feeds anyone in need. The langar is thought to serve more than 100,000 people per day and has oft been called the largest "free kitchen" in the world.

Tirumala Tirupati Balaji Temple

Where: Tirupati, Andhra Pradesh

Set in the forested Tirumala Hills in southeastern India, Tirumala Tirupati Balaji Temple welcomes upwards of 40 million visitors per year. The Dravidian-style Hindus temple is believed to date to the 4th century, though the exact time period is unknown.

For travelers and worshippers alike, the imposing architecture is among the many draws -- picture an outer wall, an inner wall, a 1.5-acre pond and several gold and white temple towers around the circumference.

Many pilgrims also shave their heads at the temple, as it's believed to enhance their humility.

For general entrance to the main hall, it's best to reserve tickets online , as this is one of the most frequented religious sites in India.

Where: New Delhi

A breathtaking example of Indian architecture, Swaminarayan Akshardham in Delhi is the world's largest Hindu temple. Though it looks ancient, the structure was completed in 2005 but built in a traditional style.

It took five years and 11,000 artisans to craft the temple out of regal materials, including Rajasthani pink sandstone and Italian marble.

You can't take your eyes of the architecture: The 141-foot-tall main temple, called the mandir, is colorful and dramatic with its nine domes, hundreds of carvings and life-size stone elephants.

But it's not all traditional. Across the halls and 60-acre gardens, visitors will discover a series of high-tech exhibitions, an IMAX theater and even a water show.

Lotus Temple

Where: New Delhi

Another modern beauty is the Lotus Temple, which welcomes roughly 10,000 visitors per day.

Built in 1986, the temple is one of seven major Bahá'í Houses of Worship around the world.

The gleaming white landmark, which was designed by Iranian-American architect Fariborz Sahba, features 27 marble panels that curve to form the shape of a blossoming lotus -- a symbol of divinity and purity.

Following Bahá'í beliefs, where the number nine is associated with unity, the temple has a total of nine sides as well as nine peaceful ponds.

Considered one of the most important sites in the Buddhist religion -- this is where Gautama Buddha (also known as Siddhartha Gautama) reached enlightenment under the storied Bodhi Tree. As such, the Mahabodhi Temple draws pilgrims from all corners of the world.

Rebuilt in the 5th century, the 11.9-acre UNESCO World Heritage Site showcases a beautiful mix of white and pink sandstone as well as intricate engravings.

The most eye-catching structure is the main pyramidal temple -- a beautiful 180-foot-tall brick structure that rises above the landscape. And for those looking for Buddha's famous Bodhi Tree, the original is no longer there but there's said to be a scion on the temple grounds.

The experience at 1st-century Meenakshi Temple, in southeastern India, begins with a breathtaking entrance. Four massive gopuras (towers) stretch overhead, adorned with hundreds, if not thousands, of colorful and ornate sculptures of deities, animals and demons.

Once inside, the 15-acre walled complex feels like a labyrinth thanks to a series of concentric enclosures, pillared walkways and lively markets.

For many, a highlight is the Thousand Pillared Hall, which has been transformed into a history and art museum that's filled with hundreds of stone sculptures.

But be prepared for a crowd. This is another popular pilgrimage site, drawing an estimated 25,000 visitors a day.

As the climate crisis makes the world hotter, people are looking to stay cool. By 2050, there could be three times as many air conditioning units on the planet as there were in 2018. But are an estimated 5.6 billion units -- and their accompanying energy demands -- really the answer?

In India, for example, the International Energy Agency believes air conditioning could account for 45% of peak electricity demand by 2050 unless things change. The vast majority of India's electricity supply still comes from coal (although heavy investment in renewables is underway). Pair dirty energy with hydrofluorocarbons , the highly-potent greenhouses gases used in air conditioning units, and you have a solution that's compounding the problem in the long term.

Luckily there's people like New Delhi architect and designer Monish Siripurapu. The founder of Ant Studio is looking at the issue of cooling and is looking back -- way back -- for answers.

India is no stranger to passive cooling systems: the famous stepwells of Rajasthan have used water evaporation to offer relief from the heat for over 1,500 years. Jaali, a type of latticed screen filtering sunlight indoors, are another centuries-old method of keeping cool. But for his solution Siripurapu turned to the Ancient Egyptians, who would fan a porous jar of water to produce cool air.

Dubbed the CoolAnt, Siripurapu's system comprises a honeycomb-like network of terracotta tubes. Water is circulated by an electric pump over the surface of the structure, inspired by a beehive for maximum surface area, he explains. Water evaporates from the terracotta surface when air passes through the tubes, cooling the air.

The studio's cooling system was first conceived for factories and places where machines throw out hot air. With temperatures in summer upward of 50 degrees Celsius near the air exhausts, the CoolAnt system can reduce the heat to the mid-30s Celsius, its creator claims.

Ant Studio's first model in a factory in Noida, Uttar Pradesh, is topped up with 200 liters of water every week, recycled by the factory, and used 3-4 hours a day, six days a week, explains Siripurapu.

"We are trying to re-adapt this in multiple places for different needs," says Siripurapu. "We have implemented (it) in a café, in a school, and we have done one in a residence."

Ant Studio's work is also providing custom for local potters, who Siripurapu says are losing out to advanced manufacturing techniques. Typically, one cooling system requires around 700 tubes. Siripurapu says the studio is looking to scale up, and is fundraising and consulting with organizations like the United Nations Environmental Programme.

There is growing interest in a return to vernacular architecture , using localized methods and materials, and bioclimatic architecture , designing to take account of the local climate without needing to use additional energy to cool or heat buildings.

In South East Asia, T3 Architecture Asia has designed affordable apartments in Ho Chi Minh City, and hotels in Cambodia and Myanmar, that feature ventilated roofs, fiber-glass insulation and open-air corridors negating the need for air con. At Expo 2020 Dubai next year, national pavilions will use numerous zero-energy cooling methods, including one inspired by "barjeel" wind towers, a concept that dates back 5,000 years.

"Civilization," Siripurapu says, "cannot continue to build the same way that we are doing."

"Unfortunately, as an architect, we are used to looking at a single client ... we don't really look at the bigger picture," he adds. "The motivation now, what we are trying to do, is (see) how our spaces, our interventions, can actually impact millions of people."

"We can still be very sustainable and make something really good." <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

Indian graffiti artist Epoc was taking a break from painting his towering, multicolored mural in Kannagi Nagar when he made a surprisingly frank admission.

He had only ever been to the district in Chennai, southern India, once before -- and that was because he was lost.

"It's not a good area to hang out in. When it gets dark, it's not safe here."

Epoc's admission was rather off-message, considering he was in Kannagi Nagar as part of a project designed to challenge precisely those kinds of opinions about the district.

In February, Indian arts nonprofit St+art recruited around 15 artists to create murals in the residential neighborhood, home to around 80,000 people.

Largely formed between 2000 and 2010, Kannagi Nagar has served as a resettlement area for residents of various Chennai slums, including many people displaced by the deadly tsunami that struck the city in 2004.

It has a reputation for being steeped in alcoholism, drug use and crime. Some residents have reportedly been refused jobs when employers discovered their address.

"When you Google Kannagi Nagar, there are articles telling you not to go there," said Karan Kaul, assistant curator of St+art. "It's cut off from the city."

St+art saw an opportunity to turn drab residential housing blocks into a series of huge canvases for Chennai's first dedicated art district.

Indian artists such as Epoc, Kashmira Sarode and Poornima Sukumar and foreigners including Austrian David Leitner and Canadian Ben Johnston took up the task of painting massive, vibrant works of art.

The new art district has raised questions about how much visiting artists painting Instagrammable images on apartment blocks can really benefit those living inside them.

But, a recent visit there suggests that the project is being received with more optimism than cynicism.

Generation gap

Kannagi Nagar's new art district -- which officially opened in late February -- is centered around blocky residential buildings flanking a large strip of dust and gravel.

In a more prosperous neighborhood, this area might have been used for a park or lawn. Here, barefoot kids play volleyball, dodging broken glass.

The strip is overlooked by the project's centerpiece: a huge black and white mural by Chennai graffiti artist A-Kill depicting two smiling sisters, based on a photograph he took of local kids.

Nearby, Leitner's work depicts a pensive-looking woman amid scattered receptacles, designed to represent the water shortages currently affecting Chennai.

On a wall facing a school, Karthik, a Chennai-based pointillism artist who uses the name SS 108, created a mural depicting a chicken riding a man.

"I wanted to make something comical," he said. "It can have deeper meaning... but it's fun to see a chicken riding a man."

He added that the art district was already benefiting local youngsters, pointing out that a few days previously he hosted a pointillism workshop for 30 children.

"It's not just coming in, painting a wall then going," he said. "The dialogue is kept up. Over two, three years, if you keep coming back, that's when you make change."

The children are also being encouraged to beautify their district.

Over 100 local kids recently helped volunteers daub colorful paint across the length of another housing block.

Epoc said that while many children were excited by the incoming artists, interactions with some older locals had been less positive.

"The kids are seeing that you can do something different and make a living out of it," he said. "But some people have been like, 'Why are you doing this? Instead of painting you could be cleaning our garbage.'"

Epoc was born in a poor section of Nungambakkam in central Chennai. "My place has a lot of rich people, but there are housing projects," he said. "I come from the projects... so I understood the point that person was making.

"And it's a generation thing. Most of the people who said that (criticism) were 50 year-olds with nothing to do. They're bored and drunk."

Off the tourist trail

St+art's aim is to change perspectives about Kannagi Nagar and dislodge social stigmas attached to its residents.

Since 2014, the arts collective has created street art projects in cities such as Mumbai and New Delhi. Murals have been worked on in city centers and featured on tourists' guided walks.

But Kannagi Nagar's rough reputation and its location approximately 15 kilometers south of downtown Chennai means it is unlikely to attract hordes of tourists.

St+art founder Akshat Nauriyal said that rather than travelers and bloggers, local people would be the beneficiaries of Kannagi Nagar's new works.

"This isn't gentrification," he said. "Although that's a valid conversation, because it (creating street art zones) has been a tool for gentrification, especially in the West. Real estate developers bring artists in on the pretext of 'giving back to the community,' then just open cafes."

He added that, to show commitment to the area, plans are being made for artists to return to create more murals and host other workshops. Local community arts leaders have been appointed, with organizers spreading the word about activities.

"We have no hipsters here," said St+art assistant curator Kaul. "When we were discussing a community celebration day I was like, 'There's no point putting it on social media.' It's really for the people... we walked around with a megaphone."

"It builds community," Nauriyal said. "People can be proud of their neighborhood, and as a result how they treat their neighborhood changes."

Whether the district's reputation can be significantly improved by the colorful revamp should become more apparent soon, but one balance has already shifted.

Now, when Googling Kannagi Nagar, you find almost as many celebratory articles about the area's huge, stunning new street art as you do about its troubles. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

If you could boil India's architecture down to a single word or phrase, what would it be? Dynamic? Melting pot? Overwhelming? Complex?

It can be all those things and more. From historic houses of worship to futuristic marvels that reflect the country's rising global status, India's architecture demonstrates where it's been and where it's going.

Here are 12 famous buildings from across one of the most historically and culturally rich places on Earth:

The Lake Palace

Completed: 1746 | Location: Udaipur, Rajasthan

Now home to one of India's most luxurious hotels , the Lake Palace (pictured top) can be found in the middle of Udaipur's Lake Pichola. Set against the backdrop of the Aravalli mountains, its gleaming white marble looks almost as if it's floating on the lake's surface.

The structure was originally built as a pleasure palace for Maharana Jagat Singh II. It stayed with his royal descendants long after his death, but by the 1950s it was practically abandoned before being converted into a hotel.

Did you know? If you're a James Bond fan, you might recognize the palace from the 1983 movie "Octopussy."

Konark Sun Temple

Completed: Circa 1250 | Location: Konark, Odisha

A UNESCO World Heritage Site, Konark Sun Temple (sometimes spelled Konarak) is a superb example of Indian temple architecture.

Dedicated to the Hindu sun god Surya, the temple faces east to greet the rising sun, whose rays illuminate the entrance. It was designed in the shape of huge chariot, pulled by seven stone horses (only six of which still stand) and 12 pairs of wheels, symbolizing the days of a week and the months in a year.

Its main sanctum is believed to have once stood at 70 meters (229 feet) tall, though it has since fallen. Despite lying partial in ruins, the temple is still considered an excellent example of the region's so-called Kalinga architecture.

Did you know? The temple is decorated with reliefs featuring lions, The temple is decorated with reliefs featuring lions, birds, mythological creatures , musicians, dancers and even erotica.

Taj Mahal Palace Hotel

Completed: 1903 | Location: Mumbai

The regal Taj Mahal Palace hotel is one of Mumbai's most iconic structures.

It's an enticing union of European and Islamic architectural influences -- unsurprising, given that the project was started by two Indian architects and completed by an English engineer.

Standout features include so-called "onion" domes and a pointed arch borrowed from 16th-century Islamic architecture. The hotel -- which has hosted celebrities and politicians from the Beatles to Barack Obama -- features an additional modern tower completed in 1973

Did you know? The hotel has a storied but tragic history. It was used as a hospital during World War I and, in 2008, was the site of a The hotel has a storied but tragic history. It was used as a hospital during World War I and, in 2008, was the site of a deadly terror attack

Resembling spaceships come to land, Indian firm Infosys' campus offers a futuristic vision of architecture in the country.

Designed by Indian architect Hafeez Contractor , the first of the egg-like structures was completed in 2006 , with a duplicate following later.

The buildings , which are made of glass, steel and aluminum, each have five stories and are tilted at an angle of around 10 degrees.

Completed: 1929 | Location: New Delhi

The Rashtrapati Bhavan is the official residence of India's president.

The H-shaped building was designed during British rule, when it was known as the Viceroy's House. When India became independent in 1947, it was renamed Government House before taking on its current name in 1950 under India's first president, Rajendra Prasad.

Perhaps the most notable feature of the Rashtrapati Bhavan is the tall dome at its center. The building is made almost entirely of stone, with very little steel used in its construction.

Its design blends Hellenic and Indian architecture , with the latter represented by features such as "jaalis" (indented stone slabs containing floral and geometric patterns).

Did you know? This mansion contains a lot of rooms -- 340 to be exact -- and its corridors have a combined length of 2.5 kilometers (1.55 miles).

Victoria Memorial

Completed: 1921 | Location: Kolkata

The Victoria Memorial is among the most striking structural reminders of British rule in India. The large marble building, dedicated to the memory of Queen Victoria, functions as a museum and is a major tourist destination in eastern India's largest city.

It was built in the Indo-Saracenic (or Indo-Gothic) style, which blended classic Mughal architecture with Neoclassical or Gothic revival styles popular in Europe.

The building's central dome, which houses a marble statue of Queen Victoria, rises to 56 meters (184 feet).

Did you know? If the Victoria Memorial's stunning white facades remind you of the Taj Mahal's, that's because both structures were built using marble from the same quarries in Rajasthan.

Mysore Palace

Completed: 1912 | Location: Mysore, Karnataka

Another prime example of the Indo-Saracenic revivalist style, Mysore Palace is one of southern India's most spectacular and visited sites.

Built in the early 20th century, the rulers of Mysore's long-serving Wadiyar dynasty commissioned British architect Henry Irwin to design the palace. The structure consists of square towers covered with pink domes, while the striking gray granite facade is made up of a series of arches.

It's three stories tall in most places, though its highest tower reaches to 44 meters (145 feet).

Did you know? The palace is spectacularly illuminated with The palace is spectacularly illuminated with almost 100,000 lights on Sundays, public holidays and during the local Dasara festival.

Hawa Mahal

Completed: 1799 | Location: Jaipur, Rajasthan

The name Hawa Mahal means "Palace of Breeze," with its natural circulation produced by more than 950 honeycomb-shaped exterior windows that help keep the palace cool in Rajashtan's hot summers.

The intricately carved windows once allowed the palace's royal inhabitants to look out to the streets below without being seen by the public.

Lotus Temple

Completed: 1986 | Location: Delhi

Although younger than the other temples on this list, the Lotus Temple is nonetheless one of India's best-known thanks to its enticing flower-like shape -- a nod to the sacred lotus flower.

The enchanting building's circular structure is formed from 27 concrete slabs clad in white marble. These "leaves" are organized in groups of three on each of the temple's nine sides.

The temple serves as a place of worship for the Bahá'i faith, though it is open to people of any religion. It reportedly welcomes an average of over 10,000 visitors a day

Did you know? The Lotus Temple was designed by The Lotus Temple was designed by architect Fariborz Sahba , a Canadian of Iranian descent. Sahba also designed the Terraces at the Shrine of the Báb in Haifa, Israel, one of the holiest sites of the Bahá'i faith.

Red Fort

Completed: 1638 | Location: Delhi

This is not a single building, per se. But the Red Fort is simply too spectacular to be left off this list.

Also known as Lal Qila, the Red Fort is said to represent the power and creativity of Mughal Empire, the dominant force on the Indian subcontinent for more than two centuries. The huge complex derives its name from the color of its walls, which are made from red sandstone.

At 33 meters (108 feet) tall, this UNESCO World Heritage site offers a fascinating blend of influences. Islamic, Persian, Timurid and Hindu traditions can all be found in the design of the ornate residence.

Witness to the grand sweep of Delhi's history since the 17th century, its walls contain domed palaces, private apartments, garden and the Moti Masjid (or "Pearl Mosque").

Golden Temple (Harmandir Sahib)

Completed: Early 1600s | Location: Amritsar, Punjab

The temple's dazzling white buildings line the edge of the man-made Amrit Sarovar (Pool of Nectar). Visitors can reach the sanctum via a narrow walkway, called the Guru's Bridge, that carries them across the water.

The building isn't particularly large -- it was built on a 67-square-foot platform that sits below ground level and contains just three stories. And though it's a holy Sikh site, the design is considered an exquisite harmony of Islamic and Hindu construction styles

Did you know? The temple has undergone huge changes over the centuries, and the gold foil on the exterior The temple has undergone huge changes over the centuries, and the gold foil on the exterior wasn't added until 1830

Taj Mahal

Completed: 1648 | Location: Agra, Uttar Pradesh

If someone only knows one building in India, it will be the Taj Mahal -- a structure so revered that it was named as one of the New Seven Wonders of the World in a global contest in 2007.

The building was built as a mausoleum by Mughal emperor Shah Jahan in memory of his favorite wife, Mumtaz Mahal

UNESCO says it's "considered to be the greatest architectural achievement in the whole range of Indo-Islamic architecture ... (with) a rhythmic combination of solids and voids, concave and convex and light shadow; such as arches and domes further increases the aesthetic aspect." <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Hong Kong (CNN) Only a week ago, Hong Kong seemed like a model for how to contain the novel coronavirus , with a relatively small number of cases despite months of being on the front lines of the outbreak .

That was in large part thanks to action taken early on, while cases were spreading across mainland China, to implement measures that are now familiar throughout the world: virus mapping, social distancing, intensive hand-washing, and wearing masks and other protective clothing.

Hong Kong was proof that these measures worked, with the city of 7.5 million only reporting some 150 cases at the start of March, even as the number of infections spiked in other East Asian territories like South Korea and Japan, and spread rapidly across Europe and North America.

Now, however, Hong Kong is providing a very different object lesson -- what happens when you let your guard down too soon. The number of confirmed cases has almost doubled in the past week, with many imported from overseas, as Hong Kong residents who had left -- either to work or study abroad, or to seek safety when the city seemed destined for a major outbreak earlier this year -- return, bringing the virus back with them

On Monday, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced that all non-residents would be barred from the territory as of Wednesday, the latest addition to a raft of new measures.

This is a pattern playing out across parts of Asia -- mainland China, Singapore, Taiwan -- that were among the first to tackle the outbreak. All are now introducing new restrictions as a sudden wave of renewed cases begins to crest.

Compared to major cities in the West, like London or New York, residents in Hong Kong can sometimes feel as if they're living in the future. Many of the measures enacted in the Asian metropolis back in February are now being rolled out in European and American cities.

But this latest lesson may be a bitter pill to swallow, as it indicates that quarantines and social distancing must continue well beyond the initial wave of cases, if another round of infections is to be avoided.

For those just going into lockdown, that could mean they're in for the long haul.

Office workers and pedestrians wearing protective masks walk along Queen's Road Central in the Central district of Hong Kong on Friday, March 20, 2020.

Waves of infection

On March 2, after several weeks of working from home, the majority of Hong Kong's 180,000 civil servants returned to their offices . Private employers, which have largely been taking their lead from the government, followed suit, and the city's subway system, though never exactly empty, was suddenly flush with people again.

This seemed like a reasonable measure at the time. Even as cases were on the rise in Italy and elsewhere, there were then only 100 confirmed in Hong Kong, and in mainland China the number of new infections was beginning to stabilize.

It was natural therefore that people began to relax somewhat, not only going to work instead of staying home, but also having dinner together, going to the park, and attending weddings and other large social gatherings. While face masks were still common, some people could be spotted going uncovered, particularly for short trips, and there was a general sense of slowly getting back to normal.

In the week that followed the March 2 return to work, there were only five new cases in Hong Kong, most of which were imported. Numbers remained low until around March 16, when dozens of new cases were confirmed. It soon became clear that while the majority were coming from overseas, quarantine measures in place were not sufficient, and local transmission had resumed.

Since then, the city has been racing to get back on top of the outbreak, with draconian new controls put in place, including electronic tagging of all new arrivals, who must undergo a strict 14-day home quarantine, and could face criminal prosecution if they are found in breach of it. Over the weekend, police could be seen patrolling nightlife districts looking for those violating quarantine, arresting at least five people , two of whom had cut their wristbands off in order to go out.

As of Monday, civil servants are working from home again, and many private businesses are expected to follow suit. One of the government's top health advisers has warned that authorities may have to order a more comprehensive shutdown and provide financial assistance to those affected, if it is to contain the new wave of infections.

All non-residents will be barred from the territory as of Wednesday. The city's international airport will also no longer allow travelers to transit through Hong Kong. Anyone arriving in the city will have to undergo testing, regardless of their origin. Many bars and restaurants will also be closed, with initial restrictions focused on those serving alcohol.

No time to relax

Speaking Saturday, Lam said that so far the city has "effectively and safely sailed through two waves of epidemic."

"The first wave was the worries of transmissions from mainland (China), so we have put in a lot of measures," she said. "The second wave was the local transmissions, with those clusters arising from dinners and other things. Now we are facing the third wave."

Lam said that it was "only natural" that as the number of new cases subsides, people start "to relax a bit," and this is what happened towards the start of March. But she said that "in light of the changing circumstances and this most difficult and challenging wave arising from a surge in the global situation and the large number of returnees, then we have to adjust."

Singapore on Sunday introduced stringent new restrictions on travelers from overseas, as that city too struggles with imported cases and a potential second wave. Taiwan, another territory credited with effectively containing the initial outbreak, is also adopting new measures to avoid a spike in imported infections.

In the Chinese capital Beijing, all international flights are now being diverted to other cities in China, as the number of imported cases continues to rise.

Asia is weeks, if not months, ahead of the West when it comes to the coronavirus pandemic. Countries across Europe and North America were slow to learn from those who had already been through it, leaving themselves vulnerable to the rapidly worsening health crises they are experiencing now. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

He is a ranking member of the opposition party, the Indian National Congress and was a former Minister for Information and Broadcasting, Government of India. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) India witnessed one of the most melancholy moments in its recent past when the eminent historian Ramachandra Guha was dragged away by the Bengaluru police during the anti Citizenship Amendment Act protests.

His apparent offense? Participating in the right of dissent that is the holy grail of any constitutional democracy. Guha and others have rightfully taken a stand against the Citizenship Amendment Act, passed by the upper and lower houses of India's Parliament, which is vague and unconstitutional because it makes fast-tracked citizenship dependent on one's religion.

Watching Ramachandra Guha being taken away reminded me of his riveting exposition on why India is the most fascinating country in the world. The central thesis being how India had emerged as a religiously pluralistic society when most nations have defined themselves through a monotheist lens.

Indeed, India can be said to be a utopia that defines itself by the phrase "unity in diversity." I wrote in an earlier op-ed that "out of a bloodstained Partition there emerged two ideas of nationhood -- a progressive, pluralistic and inclusive impulse that became the idea of the Republic of India and a theocratic template that became the idea of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan." Sadly the events playing out through the actions of the government depict a trajectory that is distinct from the vision of a pluralistic society.

India has been the birthplace of religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, Sikhism, Jainism, which add to its cultural smorgasbord. Even the Abrahamic religions have a unique history in India. Syriac Christians in India emerged shortly after Christ died and 600 years before Islam came into being. History records that Thomas the first, one of Jesus' 12 apostles, landed in Kerala to spread Christianity and today, he is buried in Tamil Nadu. The country today is host to a significant population of the Christian faith.

Islam came peacefully to the south and has a slightly more complicated history up north. Today, India has the second largest Muslim population in the world, despite not being an Islamic country. India is one of the few countries which houses members of the Jewish diaspora who have never faced any form of state-led persecution.

More interesting is the story of the Parsi community and their arrival in India. While fleeing religious persecution in Persia, they docked on Indian shores, in modern day Gujarat. Apocryphal tales have it that the King Jadhav Rana sent a bowl of milk filled to the brim, implying that he would not be able to accommodate them. The Parsis returned the same bowl of milk with sugar in it to convey that, just as the sugar had seamlessly mixed with the milk, they too would integrate effortlessly.

For centuries, India has assimilated, internalized, accommodated and embraced waves of immigrants, invaders, traders and preachers among others. The Citizenship Amendment Bill 2019 (CAB), coupled with the National Register of Citizens (NRC) -- a register of all Indian citizens whose creation is mandated by the citizenship act of 1955, subsequently amended in 2003 -- is an assault on India's pluralistic ethos. It is an affront to the first principles of constitutionalism. It violates Articles 14, 15, 16, 21, 25 and 26 and the basic structure doctrine now cast in stone in the 1973 Indian Supreme Court case of Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala, which, by a slender majority, mandated that certain articles that form the core of the Constitution are beyond even the amending powers of Parliament.

In a secular nation like India, religion cannot be the basis of citizenship, whether territorial or extra-territorial. It also militates against the first principle of reasonable classification under Article 14 -- equals cannot be treated as unequals. You cannot make religion the determinant for granting refuge, asylum or citizenship.

The act seems to be testing the waters for a pan-India NRC that would make the citizenship of billions subject to the whimsical biases and ideological predilections of those in government today in New Delhi. Moreover, the Citizenship Amendment Act adopts different benchmarks for Bangladesh and Bhutan. The government's defense is that it is meant to protect persecuted minorities in its pan-Islamic neighborhood, specifically, non-Muslim minorities in Pakistan, Afghanistan and Bangladesh.

However, Maldives too is Islamic as per Article 10 of its Constitution. Yet, the bill does not extend the same privileges to minorities in the island nation as it does to those of Pakistan, Bangladesh and Afghanistan. Sri Lanka is a predominantly Buddhist country, where the Tamil minority (largely Hindu) have long faced persecution at the hands of pro-Sinhalese nationalists. Why does the act exclude them then? What about Ahmadis, Shias, and Baloch in Pakistan? Yes, they're Muslim, but they have been under the shoe of Sunni hardliners, and hardships have been further exacerbated by the military establishment and the constitution in Pakistan that refuses to recognize Ahmadis as Muslims. There is also the case of persecuted Christians in Bhutan.

What would have been more magnanimous on the part of the government would have been comprehensive legislation that is holistic and welcomes all individuals fleeing persecution and not drawing arbitrary lines to gauge persecution based on religious denominations.

There are many shades of grey here and hence we need nuances separating illegal migrants from refugees and granting citizenship on a case-by-case basis in a non-discriminatory manner.

India is in uproar, in protest, in ennui, in disenfranchisement, in pain, in anger, in suffering. If this government cares about its image globally, then it knows that at this rate, it is in trouble. Good governments listen to the pulse of the nation and can diagnose pain points expeditiously. It's one thing for this government to have won an election decisively but today it's ability to govern is seriously in question.

India has stood the test of democracy, when all others around it became tin pot dictatorships run by the military. When imperialism and colonialism retreated across the world, especially in Asia, Africa and Latin America, India was one nation that did not go under either totalitarian or one party rule, and never, ever under a military jackboot. Our glorious pluralistic and democratic credentials should make us a shining beacon for the global South. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) Across India, people are protesting the implementation of the Citizenship Amendment Act , (CAA) after the bill was passed in both the country's upper and lower houses of Parliament. The CAA grants fast-tracked citizenship to undocumented migrants from the "Hindu, Sikh, Buddhist, Jain, Parsi or Christian community from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan, who entered into India on or before the 31st day of December, 2014."

Muslims are left out.

The government's informal reasoning here is that the countries listed in the CAA are Muslim-majority countries. Minority religions, who are more likely to face persecution in their home countries, therefore deserve fast-tracked citizenship. The Chief Minister of Gujarat summarized this sentiment when he said , "Muslims have 150 countries where they can live, but for Hindus there is only one country, and that is (India)."

However, according to the Indian Constitution , India is a "sovereign socialist secular democratic republic." Including religion as a criterion for citizenship in a secular democracy like India is fundamentally unconstitutional.

But the CAA isn't just a danger to those it seemingly chooses to leave out -- it's a threat to all Indian citizens. It seeks to redefine what it means to be an Indian through a new lens, notably one in which public dissent and the right to protest will not be tolerated.

Protestors hold up their signs at the Gowali Tank Maidan in Mumbai.

The CAA also opens old wounds -- specifically the human cost of Indian independence from the British, which came in the form of partition, the violent separation of India and Pakistan in 1947. Pakistan chose to become an Islamic Republic, while India became a secular one. In doing so, many Muslims and Hindus on each side of the border fled to the side they felt safest on.

Still, despite the border movements, India today is home to the second-largest Muslim population globally. And the safety Muslims were promised in young and independent India is once again under threat.

The Bharatiya Janata Party, which Prime Minister Narendra Modi leads, insists this act is not "anti-Muslim," but this follows a dangerous pattern in the BJP, which has made no effort to distance itself from its Hindu nationalist agenda. Many members of the BJP advocate for "Hindutva," a principle that aims to define Indian culture through Hindu values.

And earlier this month, the BJP's Twitter account deleted a tweet from November of this year which said, "We will ensure the implementation of NRC in the entire country. We will remove every single infiltrator from the country, except Buddha, Hindus, Sikhs: Shri @AmitShah #NaMoForNewIndia."

Not surprisingly, Indians have finally taken to the streets to say, "Enough." We are not a people who will stand for this divisiveness. And despite bans on protesting in several states, the protests continue

The Indian people want their government to know that they can and still need to be held accountable. On December 19, I partook in a protest at Gowalia Tank Maidan -- the same park from which Mahatma Gandhi started the Quit India Movement in 1942.

As people chanted "Hindu-Muslim ek hai, Modi-Shah fake hai!" ("Hindu-Muslim are one, Narendra Modi and Amit Shah are fake!") and "Inquilab Zindabad" ("Long live the revolution"), I saw the real India: one of unity. In a sea of protesters with signs that compared detention camps for undocumented immigrants to concentration camps (the majority of people awaiting to be deported are Muslim ), and the BJP to the Nazis, I saw volunteers who formed human chains to ensure women could move in and out of the protest grounds with ease, and strangers sharing water in the afternoon sun.

It is growing increasingly apparent that the BJP government is trying to build a Hindu nation. And the cost is clear. But why now, when the Indian economy is on the brink of a growth recession

Today, the BJP comes after the tribal peoples of Assam, the Dalits and the Muslims, and says the CAA welcomes the Hindus, Sikhs, Parsis, Jains and Christians -- but have we any guarantee that it will stop there?

As the rest of the world looks on, Indians know that we're at a pivotal point that will decide the future of Indian democracy. We've been here before. We've sat in the same parks and walked the same paths as those who fought for Indian freedom to begin with -- and we've won.

Jerusalem (CNN) As the spread of coronavirus affects virtually every aspect of life in Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has become a staple of prime-time television. Most evenings, he can be found on the 8pm news broadcasts issuing new instructions and trying to reassure the country of 8.7 million people that everything will be fine.

Netanyahu has called for a national emergency government, consisting of all of the parties in the Knesset -- except the Arab parties -- to deal with the impact of the coronavirus. "In light of the world and national crisis, we have to unite our strength and form a strong and stable government that can pass a budget and take tough decisions," he said in a statement Sunday.

But he never included the Joint List of Arab parties, accusing them repeatedly of supporting terror in keeping up with his campaign strategy of attacking the political factions that represent some 20% of the country's population.

He suffered a significant political setback on Sunday evening, when Israel's President announced that Netanyahu's main opponent, Blue and White leader Benny Gantz , had received enough support from lawmakers to get first crack at forming a new government. But Netanyahu continues to insist it is he, and not his inexperienced rival, who should be leading the country through the crisis.

Netanyahu's supporters see him as uniquely qualified to lead the country in this time of need. The longest serving prime minister in Israel's history has guided the country through several wars, dealt with dozens of world leaders, and largely become the face of Israel. To them, the coronavirus is one more challenge Netanyahu is sure to overcome.

(CNN) COVID-19 presents a once-in-a-generation challenge. But this painfully unpredictable new world conjures a risk of miscalculation between global adversaries, in conflicts where knowns and norms held crisis at bay.

It throws normal assessments off balance. It introduces the possibility that a troublesome neighbor may be weak, or a long-term threat not as threatening as it has been for the past decades. Governments or militaries may see opportunity -- or danger -- where before certainties of response meant they ruled it out.

As I write, an extraordinary tit-for-tat is occurring between the Iranian-backed Iraqi Shia militia group Kataib Hezbollah and the United States. Three Coalition personnel were killed by rocket fire in Iraq , prompting CENTCOM to retaliate, leveling Kataib Hezbollah facilities and possibly killing their personnel.

In normal times, this would chime with the US killing in January of top Iranian commander Qasem Soleimani, and hint at an escalation towards open conflict. Does the minimal attention this escalation is getting mean it will pass without further incident, or rapidly develop into something worse? We simply don't know. Against the backdrop of a pandemic, all normal bets are off.

Iran is the first, big uncertainty in the equation. COVID-19 has likely left it vulnerable, weak and angry. Washington's campaign of "maximum pressure," sanctions and other less visible methods of punishment, has inflicted some damage. But according to Ali Vaez, Crisis Group's Iran Project Director, the Trump administration may see "the outbreak as the final nail in the Iranian economy's coffin and (be) likely less interested in any mutually beneficial compromise."

(CNN) Iran has been rapidly expanding a major cemetery in Qom, the area worst hit by the country's novel coronavirus outbreak, satellite images obtained by CNN reveal.

The country has reported at least 10,075 confirmed coronavirus cases and 429 deaths, the third-highest number of cases after mainland China and Italy.

The satellite images from March 1 and March 8, put out by Maxar Technologies, appear to show an increase in activity inside the Behesht-e Masoumeh cemetery in Qom. The images show what looks like two fresh trenches of graves on March 1, with more excavation after that.

According to Islamic tradition, bodies are supposed to be buried quickly after death. But Behesht-e Masoumeh morgue director Ali Ramezani told Iranian state TV earlier this month that burials were being delayed as testing for the virus takes time. And while corpses are traditionally washed with soap and water before burial in Iran, two medical workers in Qom told CNN that in some cases precautions related to the outbreak are preventing staff from observing traditional Islamic guidelines for burial.

A video from the morgue showed dozens of bodies sheathed in black bags on the floor of an Iranian morgue, while workers in protective suits and masks busily walk among them.

(CNN) India has once again topped an annual list of cities with the worst air quality in the world, according to a new report, while Chinese cities have continued to show improvements from the previous year.

Twenty-one of the world's 30 cities with the worst air pollution are in India, according to data compiled in IQAir AirVisual's 2019 World Air Quality Report, with six in the top ten.

Ghaziabad, a satellite city of the capital New Delhi in northern Uttar Pradesh state, is ranked as the world's most polluted city, with an averagePM 2.5 concentration measurement of 110.2 in 2019. That's far more than double the level which the US Environmental Protection Agency regards as healthy -- it's nine times more.

And in November, a public health emergency was declared after the air quality index (AQI) level exceeded 800 in certain parts of New Delhi, which was more than three times the "hazardous" level.

Researchers from IQAir -- a global air quality information and tech company -- gleaned data for the report from on the ground monitoring stations that measure levels of fine particulate matter, known as PM 2.5, per cubic meter.

The microscopic particles, which are smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter, are considered particularly harmful as they are small enough to enter deep into the lungs and cardiovascular system.

PM 2.5 includes pollutants such as sulfate, nitrates and black carbon. Exposure to such particles has been linked to lung and heart disorders and can impair cognitive and immune functions.

According to the World Health Organization, air pollution causes an estimated 7 million premature deaths a year globally, mainly as a result of increased mortality from cardiovascular diseases, cancers and respiratory infections.

It is estimated that more than 80% living in urban areas which monitor air pollution are exposed to air quality levels that exceed WHO guideline limits, with low- and middle-income countries most at risk.

"Air pollution constitutes the most pressing environmental health risk facing our global population," the AirVisual report said.

South Asia continues to be of particular concern, with 27 of the 30 most polluted cities in India, Pakistan or Bangladesh. Pakistan's Gujranwala, Faisalabad and Raiwind, are among the ten most polluted cities, and the major population centers of New Delhi, Lahore, and Dhaka rank 5th, 12th and 21st respectively, according to AirVisual data.

Regionally, South Asia, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East are worst affected overall, with only six of 355 cities included meeting WHO annual targets, the report said.

However, South Asia has seen improvements from the previous year. National air pollution in India decreased by 20% from 2018 to 2019, with 98% of cities experiencing of varying levels of improvement. The report points to economic slowdown, favorable weather conditions, and efforts towards cleaning the air as reasons behind the decrease.

For example, the most polluted city, Ghaziabad, had an average AQI of 110.2 this year. But in 2018 it was 135.2 and 144.6. in 2017.

The report also points India's launch of the country's first National Clean Air Programme (NCAP) which aims to reduce PM 2.5 and the bigger particulate PM 10 air pollution in 102 cities by 20-30% by 2024 compared to 2017 levels.

Climate crisis and urbanization

The air quality data shows, "clear indications that climate change can directly increase the risk of exposure to air pollution" the report said, noting it impacts air quality in many cities through desertification and increased frequency of forest fires and sandstorms.

Greenhouse gas emissions , with the burning of fossil fuel a key driver of the climate crisis, is also a major cause of dirty air.

Many countries are still dependent on coal for their energy production, the biggest contributor to PM 2.5 emissions. China, for example, is the world's largest producer and consumer of coal.

Exacerbating the problem is rapid urbanization in industrializing Southeast Asian cities, which is also a major cause of air pollution and poses severe challenges to managing PM 2.5 levels, the report found.

Indonesia's Jakarta and Vietnam's Hanoi overtook Beijing for the first time among the world's most polluted capital cities, "in a historic shift reflecting the region's rapid industrialization," the report said. The two capitals have annual PM 2.5 levels which are about 20% higher than those of Beijing, according to the report.

"Fast growing cities need to make a choice if they want to grow in a sustainable manner," said Yann Boquillod, director of air quality monitoring at IQAir.

However, it's not all bad news. People power is bringing about change, he said.

"Up to recently, growth was more important than the environment, but we're seeing a very clear trend that people are demanding more from their local governments," Boquillod said.

"During the year 2019, citizens of Hanoi have massively become aware of the air quality in their city, thanks to the deployment of air monitors. This is an example how air quality data has helped to push government to improve the environment."

And in the past year residents of Jakarta have sued the government over worsening air pollution in the city.

Jakarta is Southeast Asia's most polluted city and the fifth most polluted capital -- up from 10th position in 2018, according to the report. It's on track to become the world's biggest megacity by 2030, with a population of 35.6 million, according to a 2018 Euromonitor report.

"The city's rapid growth has coincided with heightened PM2.5 levels, as the growing population adds to its notorious traffic congestion, and coal-based energy demand," the AirVisual report said.

Bright spots

Chinese cities have overall seen marked improvements in recent years, with average concentrations of pollutants falling 9% from 2018 to 2019, according to the report.

China's capital Beijing has more than halved its annual PM 2.5 levels over the past decade and has dropped out of the world's 200 most polluted cities following concerted efforts to get air pollution under control.

However, 98% of Chinese cities still exceeded WHO guidelines and 47 feature among the top 100 most polluted cities in the 2019 World Air Quality Report

Dust and sandstorms in the desert city of Hotan, in western China's Xinjiang region, make it the world's second most polluted city in 2019, with an average AQI of 110.1.

Another positive is that last year saw a significant increase in countries expanding their air quality monitoring, "with the number of monitoring stations increasing by more than 200% since the year prior."

More monitoring data is important to inform communities about the quality of the air they are breathing and helps tackle air pollution globally, the report said.

Continuous public air quality data is now available for the first time for Angola, the Bahamas, Cambodia, DR Congo, Egypt, Ghana, Latvia, Nigeria and Syria, the report found.

Yet there is still a large gap in air quality data for many parts of the world, the report said, meaning the total number of cities exceeding the WHO PM 2.5 threshold could be higher.

For example, Africa, a continent of 1.3 billion people, has less than 100 monitoring stations that make air quality data available to the public in real time.

"Often locations bearing the highest particulate pollution levels tend to also notably have the least monitoring data," said Frank Hammes, CEO of IQAir. "Leaving the most vulnerable communities without access to timely and relevant air quality data, necessary to guide actions to safeguard their health." <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Hong Kong (CNN) When the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of the novel coronavirus a public health emergency of international concern, it did so over fears that smaller or less-developed countries would struggle to contain the virus .

The flu-like respiratory illness is highly contagious and the outbreak has overwhelmed hospitals in the Chinese city of Wuhan, where it was first identified. Chinese authorities have shut down entire cities, suspended public transport and closed schools, businesses and factories in an effort to contain it.

"Our greatest concern is the potential for the virus to spread to countries with weaker health systems and which are ill-prepared to deal with it," said WHO director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, when he announced the decision on January 30.

Since then, the number of confirmed cases reported in mainland China has more than quadrupled to more than 44,653. As of Wednesday morning, more than 1,100 people had died from the virus, while 4,740 patients had recovered and been discharged from hospital.

The virus has spread across Asia and into Europe and the United States, with more than 500confirmed cases in over two dozen countries and territories, with just two deaths outside mainland China.

While the majority of cases outside of mainland China have so far been connected to travelers from China, or those who have have recently been there, a small but growing number of patients have caught the virus locally.

That's worrying, because if self-sustaining outbreaks start occurring in nations with poor healthcare systems, the impact could be devastating.

"It's an enormous concern," said Jeremy Konyndyk, senior policy fellow at the Center for Global Development.

"We still don't have a clear picture of how likely that is, but given transmissions dynamics in China and the speed with which cases have emerged in other countries, global spread seems highly plausible."

If China is struggling, how will other nations cope?

far higher than many low-income nations. China is ranked 51st out of 195 countries globally for its outbreak readiness, according to the Global Health Security Index . That's not on par with the wealthiest countries in the world, butfar higher than many low-income nations.

Authorities in China have suspended public transport and sealed off entire cities at the epicenter of the outbreak, effectively putting 60 million people on lockdown. They've built two new hospitals in less than two weeks, and dispatched thousands of medical workers to Wuhan.

Yet despite these unprecedented efforts , the country is struggling to keep the rapidly expanding outbreak under control.

People have spoken of sick family members turned away from hospitals, delays in testing and wards packed with feverish patients and limited screening or quarantine.

"If China is struggling to contain this, weaker countries will have an even harder time. And that suggests that the kind of transmission we're seeing in China might soon be mirrored elsewhere," said Konyndyk.

Where are the biggest concerns?

JUST WATCHED US citizen and 8-year-old daughter flee coronavirus epicenter Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH US citizen and 8-year-old daughter flee coronavirus epicenter 02:37

Countries close to China in Southeast and East Asia have borne the brunt of the infections outside of the mainland, with Japan, South Korea, Vietnam and Thailand seeing local transmissions.

Some of those nations with coronavirus infections and their neighbors are among the poorest and most disaster-prone countries in the world.

Experts have raised fears that the health care infrastructure in these countries could crumble under the weight of an outbreak, and severely damage their economies , cause mass displacement and lead to other non-virus deaths.

Natural disasters in the Philippines already cause millions of dollars in damage and displace thousands each year.

Powerful typhoons and a series of earthquakes battered the country in 2019, and this year a volcanic eruption in southern Luzon Island is still posing a threat to nearby residents. A dengue epidemic last summer killed more than 1,000 people and infected more than 250,000, demonstrating the strain on its health service.

To date, one person has died in the Philippines from coronavirus -- the first death outside mainland China -- and three people have been confirmed to have contracted the virus.

Students wearing protective face masks have their temperatures taken while entering their college campus in Manila.

The Asia-Pacific region is home to 60% of the world's population -- many of those countries are low or middle-income nations that are quickly industrializing.

According to the Global Preparedness Monitoring Board's 2019 report "A World At Risk," rapid urbanization can hasten the spread of disease during an outbreak.

Population booms and the migration of millions of people from rural areas to overcrowded cities with underdeveloped infrastructure and a lack of sanitation could further aggravate the spread of viruses.

India, with its population of 1.3 billion people, is one of the most rapidly developing countries in the world. By 2050, a United Nations report predicts India will have an additional 416 million urban residents. There have been three confirmed coronavirus cases in India, all three are students who had traveled from Wuhan.

While millions of people have lifted themselves out of poverty in India over the past 20 years, millions of others have been left behind.

Densely-packed city slums where thousands of people live in close proximity to one another in often sub-standard conditions could make it difficult to control a virulent viral outbreak.

Smaller, sparsely populated nations in the Pacific Ocean are also extremely vulnerable to an outbreak, though coronavirus has not been confirmed on any of these territories.

Samoa is still reeling from a measles epidemic that infected 5,707 people and killed 83, many of them children. The Samoan government declared a state of emergency in December and shut schools and government services while launching a mass vaccination campaign.

Samoan Prime Minister Tuilaepa Sailele Malielegaoi said recently that "another infectious disease outbreak will have catastrophic effects on the whole of Samoa."

Some countries have not yet reported any cases, including Indonesia, a nation of 264 million, which typically receives large numbers of Chinese tourists. Likewise, no confirmed cases have been reported in Myanmar, which borders China, India, Bangladesh, Thailand and Laos.

An outbreak in Myanmar, for example, could strain a country that's still grappling with the legacy of decades of brutal military rule, where one in four people live in poverty, and infectious diseases such as tuberculosis are among the leading causes of death.

Frontline workers risk their lives

One of the biggest concerns of a global spread would be the threat of contagion to frontline health workers, said Konyndyk from the Center for Global Development.

"Infection prevention procedures in the developing world tend to be poorly managed and weakly resourced," he said.

During the Ebola outbreaks in West Africa in 2014 and the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2019, health workers were between 21 and 32 times more likely to be infected than people in the general population, according to a report by the WHO

"Health worker infections are a huge blow, because beyond adding to case counts, they degrade the health system's capacity to fight the outbreak and they undermine the health system's work on a range of other health risks as well," Konyndyk said.

Community distrust of medical workers in some places could be disastrous, potentially leading more deaths and further spreading the virus.

When Ebola struck last year in the DRC, fear, rumors and mistrust of public health authorities and politicians meant people stayed home instead of going for treatment. Despite millions of dollars in funding and an effective experimental vaccine, Ebola spread to new provinces and re-infected areas thought to be rid of the virus.

"Spread of this novel coronavirus to such an area would easily overwhelm their testing and treatment capabilities without international assistance," said Courtney Kansler, Senior Health Intelligence Analyst with WorldAware.

"Venezuela is another good example, where there is a near-complete lack of basic medical services and healthcare infrastructure nationwide," she said.

Currently there is no evidence of confirmed coronavirus cases on the African continent or in South America.

World not ready for a pandemic

Medical staff are seen at a makeshift hospital converted from an exhibition center in Wuhan.

The WHO has appealed for a coordinated international response to help stop the outbreak from spreading, and for wealthier countries to support those with weaker health systems.

But as more countries shut their borders to travelers from China, there are concerns the restrictions will hinder sharing of public health data, or disrupt supply chains.

The WHO has not declared a pandemic -- which is essentially when there's a sustained spread of the disease in numerous countries.

But while there have been big advances in transparency, data sharing, and research tools, "the world remains meaningfully unready for a dangerous pandemic," said Konyndyk.

"Our existing medical and public health systems would be overwhelmed rapidly and there is no clear plan-B scenario for what countries should do once that happens," he said. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) The Persian New Year, or Nowruz, is a time of coming together in Iran. Alongside family, friends and strangers, Iranians take part in two weeks of rituals that include the spring equinox. Poetry is read and loved ones join one another in dance. Locals jump over bonfires to ward away sickness. Homes are cleaned, tables are symbolically rearranged. It's part of a string of customs to herald the spring and celebrate rebirth.

This year, COVID-19 has transformed these traditions. Iran is under a partial lockdown as the health ministry confirms the death toll from the virus has topped 1,200, and Iranians are encouraging each other to stay at home.

CNN spoke to Kaveh, a university student in Tehran, who describes how locals are trying to preserve the communal traditions of Nowruz while staying apart.

'Kaveh' is a pseudonym CNN has agreed to use for his safety.

What is the mood like in Tehran these days?

These are very difficult times and it shows. The mood is somber. It's somber because this is supposed to be one of the happiest times of the year. This is supposed to be one of the busiest times of the year, when people get together and visit their families. And many of the Nowruz traditions take place in the streets. Last night, for example, was a night when people jump over bonfires in hope of good health in the year to come. In certain ways, these Nowruz traditions are being adapted to the time of coronavirus. Many people limited their gatherings for the holiday last night. They set up candles in their homes or in their backyards and they jumped over the candles. It was just with their families, instead of having large parties.

As for Nowruz itself, the tradition is to go to every member of your family's house and you have lunches and dinners. Today many people are putting up banners wishing their neighbors a happy new year. And sometimes you'll see a slogan underneath that says "let's all stay at home."

As coronavirus ravages businesses in Iran, a vendor sits next to his baskets of grass shoots ahead of Nowruz in front of closed shops at Tehran's Grand Bazaar.

Part of the reason why the mood in Iran is somber is that the last two years have been a time of very difficult economic situation, because of the imposition of US sanctions by Donald Trump in 2018 when he broke the US-Iran nuclear agreement. So we went from a situation where the economy was growing, people were very optimistic about the future and there was a sense that the situation was getting better, to a situation in which the economic growth flattened, it became contracted.

This increases the difficulty of figuring out how to respond to coronavirus. On the one hand, the government shutdown of schools, university, and a lot of major institutions very early on in the attempt to limit the spread of the coronavirus, but it's very difficult to ask people indefinitely not to go to work because people will not have a source of income within a few days or weeks and there's a fear that people will start starving in their homes if the government forbids them from going outside.

Could you describe a moment from the mini-celebrations of Nowruz in the last few days that really stuck out for you?

Nowruz is always a time of joy. One of the reasons it's so joyful is because people get together, not only family but also neighbors. The street celebrations bring together people who often don't even know each other. There's traditions where people go door to door asking for sweets. People give out sweets and it really is a time when bonds are created between people. So social distancing is very difficult for people because it prevents them from connecting with each other.

A lot of people have tried to replace physical connection with virtual connection. They'll read poetry to each other over voice messages. They'll send their friends and family poems or even recipes. There's a lot of ways that people are trying to communicate with each other using technology. They're sharing the moments that they're having, whether it's jumping over candles at home with their children, and sending it to their grandparents who they haven't been able to see in weeks because they're afraid of infecting them, or neighbors greeting each other from balconies from afar and wishing each other a happy Nowruz, while also trying to maintain a physical distance so that they don't accidentally hurt each other.

It's very sad but it's also beautiful to see how even in these most trying of circumstances -- both because of coronavirus and because of sanctions and the economic situation -- people still insist on finding ways to connect with each other. Finding ways to give each other hope. And also keep each other safe from the spread of the virus.



What do we expect to happen at the time of the equinox?

They'll have a more quiet new year, but one in which you'll hear fireworks in the street. You'll hear people playing music from their balconies. You'll hear people's individual celebrations but trying as much as possible to make them collective. To show collective solidarity even under these conditions of isolation.

Iranians typically jump over bonfires to ward away sickness before Nowruz. This year, as traditions are transformed by the coronavirus, many have resorted to jumping over candles in their houses.

What is it like to be in Tehran and by the hour to be hearing about more deaths and more cases of coronavirus?

It's a very scary time to be constantly be hearing about people dying and getting sick by coronavirus, especially because unlike Europe or the US it's been here for a month if not longer. When you're staying home and when you're going about your daily life and trying to limit your movement, the main reminder of what's happening is the shrieks of ambulances in the distance.

It's seeing the amount of ambulances in front of hospitals if you pass them. And it's hard sometimes to wrap your head around what's happening. It's scary but, on the other hand, it feels like we've been living through very scary times for a while. Just two months ago, people in Iran were expecting the US to bomb the country and possibly invade after the US assassinated an Iranian general and there's a fear that there's been a series of terrifying events that just keep happening and that Iranians have been forced to live through for the last few years where the feeling of siege is not something new for Iranians.

(CNN) The three coalition members wounded when rockets struck a military base in Iraq on Saturday were US personnel, a US military official told CNN.

It was not immediately clear whether they were military personnel or civilian.

The al-Taji base was hit by its second rocket attack in a week early on Saturday local time, Col. Myles B. Caggins III, a spokesman for the international Operation Inherent Resolve (OIR), confirmed on Twitter.

Caggins said three coalition troops and two Iraqi troops were wounded and authorities were assessing the damage.

Iraq's Baghdad Operations Command said earlier on Saturday that several Katyusha rockets landed inside the airbase.

In a statement, the Operations Command said they knew where the rockets were fired from.

"Our security forces have discovered the location of the firing of Katyusha rockets that targeted al-Taji airbase north of the capital Baghdad this morning. We discovered 7 rocket launchpads inside a parking garage in the area of Abu al-Ezzam," it said.

The statement added that the owner of the parking garage, employees and all those present were taken in for questioning by Baghdad police.

These photos from the international Operation Inherent Resolve show the impact of the strike on Saturday.

The Joint Operations Command described the attack as "brutal" and said the injured Iraqis were "all in a critical condition."

There have been multiple rocket attacks in Iraq in recent weeks. Two US service members and one British coalition service member were killed and around a dozen others injured in an attack on the same base on Wednesday.

The US said Thursday it had assessed that an Iranian-backed group was responsible for the rocket attack.

The two Americans were the first to die in a rocket attack in Iraq since December when a US contractor was killed in another attack on a base near Kirkuk.

The December attack prompted retaliatory US airstrikes against militia targets in Iraq and Syria. Trump administration officials pointed to the contractor's death as their justification for air strikes that killed Iran's second most powerful leader, Gen. Qassem Soleimani, and spiked tensions around the world.

The latest attack on the al-Taji base comes after the US carried out retaliatory airstrikes on Thursday against multiple Iranian-backed militia sites in Iraq, according to the US Defense Department.

At least six people were killed -- five of them military personnel -- and 11 others were injured by the US-led coalition air strikes, Iraqi military said in statement.

The Iraqi military said the US-led coalition attack violated the partnership agreement.

"The joint operations command strongly condemns this attack that targeted the Iraqi military establishment, which violates the principle of partnership and coalition between the Iraqi security forces and the party that planned and executed this treacherous attack."

Correction: This story has been updated to reflect that the two American deaths were the first from a rocket attack in Iraq since December. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Maarat Misreen, Idlib, Syria (CNN) From a distance, there is an air of jubilation. The kids wave bright balloons and wiggle to a cheery tune. This could be any schoolyard, anywhere in the world. But the cheery faces of the children and their delightful squeals are a temporary illusion. The blaring music is a shield, giving these kids a moment of respite from the rumble of explosions from Syria's brutal civil war.

The music stops. The chorus of artillery and shelling reasserts itself. Then comes a melancholic silence. "You see the fear in their eyes, you see them looking up to check if there are any planes," said Bilal al-Shawa of the Hurras Network, a child protection charity.

Hurras has organized this activity at a school in the town of Maarat Misreen in Idlib province, Syria's last opposition enclave. "The children should be thinking about playing, about studying. Our entire focus right now is how to we avoid having them hear something scary," al-Shawa told CNN.

There is little anyone can do to protect the children physically, so al-Shawa and his organization are trying to keep the kids healthy mentally.

Plumes of smoke rise following Russian airstrikes on the village of al-Bara in the southern part of Syria's northwestern Idlib province on March 5, 2020.

In areas of Syria controlled by rebels or Turkish troops, Hurras runs weekly psycho-social support sessions focusing on building children's resilience and coping skills, as well as one-on-one support for those who need it. The charity also works with parents, to help them learn skills to support their children, and reduce harm at home.

(CNN) Two senior Saudi royals are among several members of the royal family arrested on Friday, two sources with knowledge of the arrests have said, confirming an apparent bid to consolidate Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman's power.

The brother of Saudi Arabia's King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud and a former crown prince were among those detained, one Saudi source, who requested anonymity for fear of reprisal, said Sunday.

He told CNN that several senior royals were detained in the capital Riyadh on Friday, including Prince Ahmed bin Abdulaziz al Saud, a brother of Saudi King Salman, and Prince Mohammed bin Nayef bin Abdulaziz al Saud, the king's nephew who is known as MBN.

Prince Ahmed was arrested along with a security detail, the source said. The prince had been on vacation in Morocco, and was arrested two days after returning to the kingdom.

The newly arrested royals have been taken to the same detention facility as the former King's son Turki bin Abdullah, the source added.

(CNN) Turkey and Russia announced a ceasefire in Idlib, Syria's last opposition enclave on Thursday, agreeing to establish a security corridor with joint patrols.

The announcement came after a nearly six hour long meeting between the two countries' leaders in Moscow. The ceasefire begins at midnight local time and freezes an advance by the Syrian government that has triggered a humanitarian crisis

The security corridor will be six kilometers (3.7 miles) to the north and to the south of the strategic M4 highway running through Idlib province. Turkey and Russia will begin carrying out joint patrols along the highway on March 15.

But it is unclear what, if any, mechanism will be implemented to enforce the ceasefire.

"In this process, Turkey reserves the right to respond to any attacks from the regime, anywhere and with full force," Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan said in a news conference after the summit. "Until there is a lasting peace in the Syria crisis that ensures the country's territorial integrity and political unity, Turkey is committed to continuing all its initiatives," he added.

(CNN) Iran has nearly tripled its stockpile of low enriched uranium since November, indicating a significant jump in production, according to a confidential report issued by the International Atomic Energy Agency, the United Nation's nuclear watchdog.

In the March 3 report to member states, and obtained by CNN, the IAEA said that Tehran's stockpiles of low enriched uranium now far exceed 300 kilograms, the limit set by the 2015 Iran nuclear deal.

The report said that as of February 19, "the Agency verified that ... Iran's total enriched uranium stockpile... was 1020.9 kilograms (+648.6 kilograms since the previous quarterly report)."

Low enriched uranium is usually used in nuclear plants, while highly enriched uranium is used for nuclear bombs, but in theory, the increased stockpiles reduce the "breakout" time Iran would need to acquire enough weapons-grade material to create a bomb.

The IAEA report said Iran has dramatically increased the number of centrifuges it uses to produce the nuclear fuel, bringing about 1,000 of the machines back into use in recent months, including at the Fordow underground enrichment facility. Iran had agreed to halt enrichment activity at Fordow under the 2015 nuclear deal, which President Donald Trump left in 2018.

(CNN) In 1994, King Hussein of Jordan and Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin signed a declaration that both men hoped would lay the foundation for peace between their countries, and the wider region. Twenty-five years on, Jordan's Prime Minister now says the two countries' relationship is at the "lowest level" since the signing.

For generations, the international community has been trying to find a solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and now after three years in the making, the United States says it has found an answer -- President Donald Trump's "Deal of the Century."

It lays the groundwork for Israel to immediately begin annexing large chunks of the West Bank, and also foresees the eventual establishment of a Palestinian state with limited sovereignty.

In an interview with CNN's Becky Anderson, Prime Minister Omar Razzaz warned that Jordan's peace treaty with Israel could go into what he called "deep freeze mode," potentially putting it at risk.

"When this peace treaty was signed, the Jordanian hope, and maybe even the Israeli [hope] at the time, was for it to lead to a comprehensive solution at the level of the region and sustainable peace," he says. "Unfortunately, none of this materialized."

Bill Clinton, the US President at the time, witnessed the signing and applauded it as a historic moment. Now, current President Trump could undo that history.

'The Deal of the Century'

On January 28, Trump, alongside Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , unveiled his long-awaited plan, giving it the name "Peace to Prosperity. Trump claimed it presented a "realistic two-state solution" but it was rejected by Palestinian leaders, as well as by 94% of the Palestinian people, according to a respected poll.

The Israeli Prime Minister praised Washington for the plan, calling Trump "the greatest friend" Israel has ever had in the White House. Trump's plan would shrink the amount of West Bank land left for a future Palestinian state by recognizing Israel's sovereignty over all Israeli settlements in the territory, as well as the Jordan Valley -- the eastern-most part of the West Bank. Apart from a short border with Egypt, the future Palestinian state would be completely encircled by Israel.

"Is the world willing to accept this?" said Razzaz. "Do we realize where we're pushing Israel, Palestine, the region and the world?"

For decades, Jordan has played a key role in maintaining stability in the region, recognized by the United States, Israel and many others. But Razzaz told CNN none of the elements of the White House deal had been discussed with Jordan prior to its announcement, despite it containing specific financial aid projects that Jordan would benefit from.

In response, a White House official told CNN: "We're not going to get into the details of every diplomatic discussion about the Vision for Peace; however, we met with stakeholders and friends in the region many times over the last three years to discuss various ideas and concepts. We are appreciative for the insights and input we received and have incorporated many in the Vision. We sincerely appreciate King Abdullah II of Jordan for his consultations and for his care of Muslim Holy shrines in Jerusalem ."

"We will never mix political aspirations with financial deals," Razzaz says. "Pure political aspirations of the Palestinian people cannot be traded in deals."

US-Jordan relations

Jordan finds itself in a tough position. While King Abdullah II tries to maintain strong relations with the United States, he rules over a country where Palestinian grievances count as domestic Jordanian issues. More than half of all Jordan's citizens are Palestinian, with more than 2 million registered as refugees.

The Kingdom's small size and lack of resources have made it dependent on international aid. Annual US aid to Jordan has nearly quadrupled over the last 15 years.

Asked if Jordan is concerned there may be a price to pay for not supporting the White House's Middle East plan, the Prime Minister expressed confidence.

"Jordan's relationship with the US is deep, historic and strategic," he said. "So, we are not worried that that strategic relationship will be affected by this." <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Jerusalem (CNN) Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu looks set to come out top in Israel's general election , according to projections made by the country's three main television stations early Tuesday, with 90% of votes counted.

But his hopes of a straightforward path towards forming a governing majority in parliament look set to be dashed, with all three TV stations forecasting his preferred "bloc" of parties winning 59 seats -- two seats short of an overall majority.

Addressing Likud supporters in the early hours at the party's election headquarters in Tel Aviv, Netanyahu declared victory "against all the odds," saying he had withstood tremendous forces trying to unseat him. "People said the Netanyahu era was over," he declared before adding that voters trusted him "because we brought them the best decade in the history of Israel."

Netanyahu said he would convene later on Tuesday with the other right-wing and religious parties to discuss forming a "strong, national government for the state of Israel."

Projections from the TV channels suggest the momentum Netanyahu appeared to have built in the last week of the campaign carried over into polling day.

All three channels put his Likud on 36 seats, four ahead of the Blue and White party of Benny Gantz, projected to win 32 seats.

Gantz refused to accept defeat when he appeared before his party's supporters at their Tel Aviv headquarters but admitted he shared their feeling of disappointment and pain. "This is not the result we wanted and not the result that will put Israel back on the right track," he said.

Netanyahu posters at the Likud party's electoral campaign headquarters in Tel Aviv on Monday.

He also hit out at his opponents' election tactics, describing the election campaign as the most difficult in the history of Israel, saying he and his party had been the victims of lies and smears. "They thought I would break under the pressure, but I did not, and I will not," he said.

Earlier Monday, Israel's President Reuven Rivlin castigated lawmakers for running what he called an "awful and grubby election campaign" as well as for their inability to negotiate a new government after two elections last year. "We don't deserve this never-ending instability. We deserve a government that works for us," Rivlin said.

Twenty-nine parties contested the election. It now seems certain that just eight will make it over the 3.25% threshold required to win representation in the 120-seat Knesset.

The Joint List of Arab parties is projected to come a strong third behind Likud and Blue and White, winning 15 seats. The Joint List's strong showing is seen as an indication of the level of opposition among Israel's Arab communities -- which make up about 20% of the population -- to President Donald Trump's Middle East peace plan, unveiled in late January. List leader Ayman Odeh hailed his party's performance as the best result ever for Arab parties in Israeli elections.

The two main religious parties representing Israel's ultra-Orthodox population are projected to win between 17 seats between them, making them an influential part of any Netanyahu bloc. Another right-wing party, the hardline Yamina, led by Defense Minister Naftali Bennett is projected to win just six seats.

A center-left alliance of three parties, including Labor, which was once the dominant force in Israeli politics, also appears to have underperformed, on course for just seven seats in the new parliament.

Finally, the other party on track to return to parliament is Yisrael Beiteinu, led by Avigdor Liberman, once a close ally of Netanyahu, but now one of his fiercest critics. His party is projected to win just seven seats, but with the polls now suggesting a close finish, he could still play a kingmaker role.

Israelis vote at a polling booth specially erected for the 5,600 Israelis under self-quarantine, many of whom visited countries with cases of the coronavirus.

Following the last election in September, both Netanyahu and Gantz were given the chance to try to form a government but neither man was successful in building a coalition with a 61-seat majority. Gantz refused point-blank to sit in a government with Netanyahu due to the charges against the Prime Minister, while Netanyahu refused to go second in any rotating prime ministership with Gantz.

This time Netanyahu might try to entice a couple of opposition lawmakers to join a right-wing and religious coalition and give him an overall majority.

He is seeking his fifth term as Israel's prime minister -- he is already the country's longest-ever serving leader, having surpassed David Ben-Gurion's 4,875 days in office last summer.

Even though Netanyahu has been under criminal investigation for several years, it was only in January that he was formally indicted on charges of bribery and fraud and breach of trust. He denies the accusations, and there was little to suggest during the campaign the indictments had a significant impact on voters. Those Israelis who support him fully accept his complaints that the indictments are a witch hunt pursued by a liberal elite. And those Israelis who dislike the Prime Minister have been firm in that belief for many years now.

Most of the votes are expected to have been counted by the end of Tuesday, leaving just soldiers votes and Israelis voting overseas remaining. Final certified results are likely still some days away.

At some point in the coming week, most likely next Sunday, President Rivlin will summon all those party leaders who have achieved representation in parliament to consult with him over who should get first shot at building a coalition.

The President will then formally ask one of the leaders to start coalition talks -- on all but one occasion it has been the leader of the largest party -- and they will then have a maximum of six weeks to agree on the shape of the next government.

But as events have shown, not once but twice in the last year, that could prove very difficult, and it remains possible there could still be a fourth general election in late summer. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
(CNN) — Travel bans and closed borders have put wanderlust on hold, and as the United States and other countries grapple with a surge in coronavirus cases, even domestic travel is increasingly unlikely.

These mandates have left many Americans isolated at home, hopefully heeding the social distancing guidance outlined by health officials and venturing only to places like the grocery store or pharmacy.

Related content Here's everything you need to know about social distancing

Staying as close to home as possible, millions of Americans are adjusting to the new normal.

But cabin fever is a real, often unpleasant consequence of avoiding the outside world. The worst of cabin fever can be avoided in areas that are not on lockdown by regularly getting outside, moving around and witnessing seasonal changes that are marching on despite the pandemic.

Many authorities and experts, in fact, recommend outdoor activity — with caution.

"You can't just sit in your house. There's a certain point where you go stir crazy," says Dr. Daniel Griffin, an infectious disease specialist at Columbia University Medical Center.

There are, of course, several factors to consider and various limitations (by location or personal vulnerability level) in just how far outside you can venture. And in areas currently worst hit by spiking cases, most outdoor activity just isn't possible as authorities work to beat back the virus.

Read on for some general advice about going outside during the pandemic and be sure to keep tabs on local guidance as it evolves.

If you live near a wide-open space, consider it ground zero for taking in a bit of fresh air.

Psychologist Baruch Fischhoff, who studies decision-making, among other things, says it's fine to go outside, to go anywhere outdoors really, so long as you're committed to following the social distancing protocols as outlined by medical experts.

That means staying at least six feet away from anyone you aren't living with. Crowded parks or beaches teeming with people won't do.

Playgrounds and public facilities like restrooms are risky because of their high-touch nature.

In Italy, officials have closed parks, gardens and play areas, and prohibited jogging and other outdoor leisure activities, which will now only be allowed in the vicinity of people's homes.

In Los Angeles, crowded hiking trails, so overrun as to make social distancing impossible, have been shut down entirely.

In other areas, uncrowded parks and neighborhoods are still considered a fine option for fresh air.

Fischhoff, a professor in the Department of Engineering and Public Policy at Carnegie Mellon University, encourages people to think of everyone around themselves (outside of their cohabitants) as virus carriers, since there isn't enough testing to assume otherwise.

"Older and more vulnerable people such as those over the age of 60, those with diabetes, heart disease, or lung disease should consider sheltering in place in certain circumstances as these individuals would be at high risk if they were exposed and infected," says Griffin.

The six-foot rule doesn't apply to people you live with or those who you've embraced in your social cohort, a more recent term describing those select few you've chosen to isolate with.

Griffin says the concept of a social cohort related to coronavirus is gaining steam in the medical community.

"With a potential 18-month period ahead of us, this is a less draconian and hopefully feasible form of social distancing and social isolation in groups that are about the size of a large extended family that prevent spread between these isolated groups."

Like social distancing, it may be positioned to be the next phenomenon introduced in the wave of new social behavior norms.

A walk in the woods

Both Griffin and Fischhoff agree hiking is an acceptable outdoor activity, following the six-foot rule, though it's not free from risks unrelated to coronavirus.

If you head out for an hours-long trek with your spouse or roommate and one of you has an accident requiring a trip to the emergency room, you are essentially adding stress to the already overtaxed health care system. Auto accidents present the same potential stress to the system.

Thus, along with practicing social distancing and enhanced hygiene efforts, you should be wary of mundane risks.

"Always be careful, but now be a little extra careful," Griffin says.

You should drive to the hiking location in separate cars, he says, if the other person isn't someone you live with to maintain social distancing.

Should you venture out on a hike, avoiding public facilities is paramount. That bench along the trail may look inviting but sitting down on it is risky since you don't know who else has been there recently.

Griffin notes the virus' strength: It can live for days on any number of surfaces -- including that bench.

"We haven't addressed the unintuitive aspects of where hands go," Fischhoff says, stressing there's more work to do in this area.

He suggests if you can keep your hands off things or be sure not to touch your face until you've washed your hands, you can more easily sit well in your decision to go outside for a walk or a hike.

Briefly crossing paths with other humans is, however, not much of a problem. This passing contact, explains Griffin, is fortunately not considered high risk.

Do your neighbor a favor though and wait to sneeze or cough once you have the sidewalk or trail to yourself.

Camp rules

While some US national parks have closed to visitors, many others in the National Park Service remain open and are waiving entrance fees

Kathy Kupper, a public affairs specialist for the National Park Service, says the fees have been waived "to help provide people with access to nature and the many mental and physical benefits that accompany time spent outdoors."

Along with adhering to social distancing guidelines, Kupper says visitors "should also adhere to Leave No Trace principles and be prepared that some facilities might not be available, including visitor centers, restrooms, water fountains or food service."

As far as camping in national parks or elsewhere goes, if you're using a tent, be respectful of the rules and don't set up close to another campsite, Griffin said.

Many campgrounds have closed in response to coronavirus, leaving dispersed and more remote sites as the only options.

"The public restrooms at campgrounds are a bit concerning with evidence that the virus might be shed in feces, so there may be some risk here," Griffin notes.

As some individual parks and recreation sites close in response to increasing calls to curb the spread, before you head out anywhere, be sure you have the most current information. On Monday, Oregon State Parks issued a statement announcing the closure of all state parks, including all trails, viewpoints, and picnic areas and facilities. Previously, Oregon parks were to close on April 3.

The NPS website or state park department sites provide the latest information on individual facilities and park operations.

A day at the beach

Some areas have closed beach access, particularly in popular destinations that see high density during spring break.

Miami Beach, Fort Lauderdale and Tampa have issued mandates to close some of Florida's most popular beaches. In Australia, Bondi Beach is closing in response to crowds of people ignoring social distancing advice.

In California, over the weekend, beaches drew crowds , leading some city authorities to officially close beaches and other recreational areas. On Monday, a county supervisor in Los Angeles, Kathryn Barger, announced the closure of beach parking lots in Los Angeles to further deter use of the already-closed beaches.

But beaches that are open and uncrowded can provide some outdoor relief.

"it's fine to go to the beach. I encourage people to go to the beach," Griffin says, again pointing out the need for finding ways to still enjoy life and doing what we love to do.

Griffin was referring to beaches in the off-season, not the type of crowded beaches in Florida that recently made headlines over spring break, teeming with young people seemingly unfazed by calls for social distancing.

But a Jersey Shore beach or a beach in the Hamptons in March or April? It should be fine if it's not crowded and you're maintaining your distance from other off-season beachgoers.

"You're no more unsafe being at the beach than you would be sitting in your living room together," Griffin said, but he did add that the safety of going to the beach would need to be reassessed if the outbreak is still serious as the busy summer season starts.

Bottom line (for now): Yes, it's OK to venture outdoors. It's OK to stretch your legs or curl up on a blanket on an uncrowded stretch of beach. Pitch a tent that respects the social distancing requirements.

If you fall into one of the higher-risk groups, though, staying in is a good idea. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
(CNN) — For even more videos from this part of the world head to Great Big Story

For more than 30 years, Mauro Morandi has been the sole inhabitant of a beautiful island in the Mediterranean Sea. For the past few weeks his hermit's hut has been an aptly isolated location from which to watch the global coronavirus crisis unfold.

And, after being alone with his own thoughts for so much of his life, he's got some insight into the isolation that many of us now face in the weeks and months ahead.

Morandi, a former teacher, arrived on the island of Budelli, off the coast of Sardinia, by accident while attempting to sail from Italy to Polynesia 31 years ago. He fell in love with the pristine atoll's crystal-clear waters, coral sands and beautiful sunsets -- and decided to stay.

He took over from the previous caretaker shortly afterward and, at the age of 81, he's still there, having earned himself a reputation as Italy's Robinson Crusoe.

Each night he sleeps in an old stone cottage and wakes up in the morning surrounded by mother nature. He enjoys exploring shrubs and cliffs and talks to birds at breakfast as they fly in and out of his little kitchen window.

l e v a r t

He keeps up with the news though, learning first of mainland Italy's shutdown against the spread of coronavirus, and then the rest of the world's.

In his solitary world, he says he currently feels like he's in the "safest place on Earth." He's also eager to share a few tips on how to best face self-isolation.

"I am fine, I'm not scared," he tells CNN Travel via the mobile phone that is his link to the outside world. "I feel safe here. This island offers total protection. No risks at all. Nobody lands, not even a single boat can be seen sailing by."

'Tough times'

Like many of us, Morandi's main concern is for the wellbeing of his family and friends -- in his case living in northern Italy's Modena, one of the most virus-hit areas in Italy.

"They're facing tough times," he says.

Little has changed for Morandi since Italy's virus outbreak, except that he must now wait longer for people to bring him food from the mainland due to harsh restrictions imposed by Rome's government.

These have meant that even the sporadic visits from tourists during the winter have ceased. Over the years he's become accustomed to daytrippers, befriending them and sometimes sharing his meals with them.

Left alone, he spends the day admiring the sea, inhaling the pure air, collecting wood, preparing his meals and -- of course -- posting on Instagram

"I get bored, so I kill time taking photos of the beaches, the wildlife and scenery, editing shots and then sharing these on social media and Instagram," he says. "I have a lot of followers."

The wild-bearded sea dog thinks the virus shutdown, if it continues, means tourists will be staying away at least until July, but the prospect of a quieter summer doesn't scare him.

Morandi has a few tips for people now forced into solitude in Italy and elsewhere by the pandemic. He says a few weeks holed up inside is nothing to get upset about but is instead an opportunity to practice some soul searching.

He speaks, he says, from experience. Despite having an entire island to himself, even Mediterranean winters can be tough and he spends many months in confinement.

"I spend each winter shut in my house, for months on end I hardly wander across the island, but instead I kill time on the front porch under the canopy. So what the heck, people can't stay at home for two weeks? That's absurd."

As Italy tightens restrictions on movement to control the virus, dozens of Italians have been fined in the last few days for leaving their homes for non-urgent reasons like a stroll in the park or at the beach.

From wanderer to hermit

"I read a lot, and think. I think many people are scared of reading because if they do, they'll start meditating and thinking about stuff, and that can be dangerous.

"If you start seeing things under a different light and be critical, you could end up seeing what a miserable life you lead or what a bad person you are or the bad things you did."

This introspection can, he says, ultimately be highly rewarding. Morandi recounts his own transformation from an inveterate wanderer who traveled across Europe each year to a solitary islander.

"I just didn't feel like traveling anymore -- no interest," he says. "I understood that the most beautiful, dangerous, adventurous and gratifying journeys of all is the one inside yourself, whether you're sitting in the living room or under a canopy here in Budelli. That's why staying at home and doing nothing can be really hard for many."

But, he adds: "I never feel alone."

In Morandi's view, most people don't want to be alone because they can't stand their own company and the imposed shutdown is forcing many to face this.

And, he says, while the current crisis presents an opportunity to re-evaluate their lives, he doesn't think that many will make the most of it.

"I don't believe in the healing power of people to change," he says. "Perhaps some individuals will, but the majority are too accustomed to comforts and frenetic lifestyles."

Meanwhile, time flows by as usual on Budelli.

Winter this year has been milder, with spring-like temperatures and warm suns. The island's habitat remains quite untouched. No pollution. Clear fluorescent turquoise waters, lush wild vegetation, purplish rocks resembling natural sculptures and healthy air.

"My cat died just the other day, she was 20 years old," Morandi says. "Perhaps this climate does bring longevity."

'Everything I need'

Budelli is one of the most beautiful islands in the entire Mediterranean. Dating back to prehistoric times when the Earth's crust was still forming, legend says it's a shard of the mythical, lost Atlantis continent swallowed by the ocean.

But the island isn't completely immune to climate change and nature's destruction by man, says Morandi.

Not long ago a clear line of pinkish sand cut along the shore, made of bright pink, orange and salmon-tinted crushed coral, crystals, fossils and dead marine creatures, giving the shore a sparkling strawberry hue similar to that of sunset skies.

Related content Italy's best beaches and islands

"Now the pink is almost gone, hard to see," he says. "The directions of the winds blowing over Budelli have changed, the pinkish sand no longer piles up as it used to."

The mayhem on mainland Italy is allowing Budelli's caretaker to buy time over his own fate.

Ownership of the island has changed several times over the last few years. Since 2016, Budelli has been a government-owned national park, rendering Morandi's role obsolete -- a situation he has fought while continuing to live there.

The virus emergency is likely to postpone any decision over his future for the time being, though his ramshackle home is in need of a restyle.

"For now I've got everything I need. There's electricity, even if it needs a makeover, and running water, and an extra small stove for heating." <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) — Rob Atthill says he was "smitten" by Vietnamese coffee the first time he visited the Southeast Asian nation, in 2004.

A pioneer of the Vietnamese street food scene in London, Atthill started importing coffee -- grown by farmers in the country's Central Highlands and roasted in Ho Chi Minh City -- two years later. He says coffee sales, through his company Ca Phe VN , have tripled in the last five years.

Vietnam is the world's second largest exporter of coffee (after Brazil).

The drink is also extremely popular at home, where it was first introduced by French colonists in the 1850s.

For the Vietnamese, coffee provides much more than just a shot of energy -- it's a way of life. Coffee outlets range from hole-in-the-wall counters with plastic stools on the sidewalk, to sleek, contemporary cafes with roasters on the premises.

"It's about getting together with friends," says Will Frith, a coffee consultant who owns a co-roasting enterprise in Ho Chi Minh City. He says coffee drinkers tend to gather in their favorite coffee shops, which operate as "a third space," outside the home and workplace, and often form friendships with the owners and staff. Additionally, "nearly every Vietnamese household makes coffee at home," he says.

Coffee cherries are harvested -- usually by hand -- between November and February. Shutterstock

But despite the size of its export sales, and its vibrant local coffee culture, Vietnam has not gained a reputation as a source of quality coffee. And that's because of the beans.

The majority of Vietnam's coffee beans -- around 97% -- are the robusta variety.

Known for their bold, earthy, bitter flavor, and high caffeine content, robusta beans are typically used to make cheap, mass-market products, including instant coffee and supermarket blends.

Bulk business has given them a bad reputation in the high-end, specialty coffee market. Coffee connoisseurs usually opt for arabica beans, which have less caffeine, higher acidity, and a lighter, sweeter flavor.

Atthill says this attitude is outdated: "There's a lot of snobbery against robusta in the coffee industry ... but there's no inferiority. Arabica is not inherently better."

What matters, Atthill says, is the quality of the beans.

"There's high quality robusta and poor quality arabica."

Ca Phe VN's house blend, which Atthill describes as "nutty, chocolatey, strong but approachable" accounts for 90% of his sales. The blend combines 85% robusta beans, which provide body and flavor, with a dash of arabica, which adds acidity, complexity and aroma, he says.

Sahra Nguyen launched Nguyen Coffee Supply in Brooklyn, New York, in 2018. She buys coffee beans from a family-run farm in Vietnam's Central Highlands and roasts them herself.

Like Atthill, Nguyen wants to transform the reputation of the unfairly maligned robusta bean. She recently added Grit -- a 100% robusta product -- to her range, and has conducted blind taste tests in which customers sample Grit alongside two of her other coffees: Loyalty -- made from 50% robusta and 50% arabica beans; and Courage, which is 100% arabica.

Overall, more than three quarters of testers preferred Grit. The response "blew me away," says Nguyen.

Vietnamese coffee has also returned to its roots in France. Husband-and-wife team, Nam and Linh Nguyen, opened Hanoi Corner in central Paris two years ago. Along with coffee, the café offers Vietnamese tea, cakes and streetfood staples.

Vietnam has "a unique coffee culture" says Nam Nguyen, an award-winning barista. "We wanted to introduce it in France ... where nobody knows it," he says.

At the same time, specialty coffee is gaining influence back home.

Frith says a new generation of Vietnamese coffee roasters and cafe entrepreneurs are focusing on quality -- paying attention to terroir, discussing cultivation methods with farmers and adopting best practices when it comes to processing techniques.

In the last few years, a trend towards sophisticated interior design has added to the buzz, especially in Ho Chi Minh City, where he lives.

"Coffee shops here are becoming as diverse and fancy as anything you'd find in London or New York," he says.

What's on the menu?

In Vietnam, you can have a lot more added to your coffee besides milk and sugar. Here are some of the popular concoctions on offer:

(CNN) — Once upon a time, reaching the highest peak on Earth was considered a feat achievable only by a select few.

Fast forward to today.

Though it remains a costly endeavor -- and sometimes deadly -- it's logistically easy enough to arrange. Over 4,000 adventurers have climbed to the top of Mount Everest, according to the British Mountaineering Council

So what's an intrepid amateur explorer with a thirst for all things rare and superlative to do?

Travel in the opposite direction, of course, to Challenger Deep. Sitting at a depth of 10,928 meters (35,853 feet), it's widely believed to be the deepest point in the world's oceans.

In a world-first, travel company EYOS Expeditions has teamed with private undersea diving company Caladan Oceanic to offer general members of the public an opportunity to join an upcoming expedition and dive to the bottom of the Marianas Trench in the western Pacific Ocean.

How rare is this experience? According to EYOS, only seven people on earth have visited Challenger Deep. (Hollywood director James Cameron just happens to be one of them.)

Here's the catch: The company is only inviting three people to join the trip. Staff tell CNN Travel it's being offered on a first-come, first-serve basis. The cost?

US$750,000.

Four hours on the sea floor

The three travelers, called "Mission Specialists," will spend approximately eight days with the Ring of Fire Expedition, which is operated by EYOS and Caladan Oceanic.

Each submarine dive will take up to 14 hours. The descent, which is over seven miles, takes over four hours. The divers will spend up to four hours on the seafloor, where they will get to explore and potentially film their surroundings.

"This is the most exclusive destination on Earth," says Rob McCallum, founding partner of EYOS Expeditions, in a statement.

"Currently, only three manned expeditions have ever been made to the bottom of Challenger Deep and more people have been to the moon than to the bottom of the ocean."

The Mission Specialists will board the hadal exploration vessel, DSSV Pressure Drop, in June 2020 -- EYOS says the exact date is to be confirmed -- in Agat, Guam. It then takes a day at sea to reach the Marianas Trench.

The expedition will use Caladan Oceanic's submersible, Limiting Factor, which has been pressure tested in a chamber to 14,000 meters and has already dived five times to the bottom of the Mariana Trench. EYOS says it's the only vehicle ever constructed that is capable of multiple dives to full ocean depth.

"The occupants of the submersible are completely protected by the 90mm thick titanium sphere and experience no pressure changes or physiological stresses at all," says the statement announcing the trip.

Comfy seats, hi-def cameras

As a result, no formal pre-departure training is required, though Mission Specialists will receive a comprehensive shipboard and sub orientation as part of pre-dive preparations.

"The inside of the sub is quiet, peaceful and very relaxing. The sub has two comfortable seats, three view ports, and high-definition 'surround' cameras," says McCallum.

"Whilst onboard, Mission Specialists will be fully integrated members of the team and free to work alongside our sonar operator/ocean mappers, submersible technicians, film production team, expedition management and ship's officers to gain an insight into the complexities and challenges of hadal exploration," he says.

Don't worry. Even intrepid explorers need some down-time, too. McCallum says when not diving, expedition members can relax by taking in a movie, going to the gym, reading, or heading up to the "Sky Bar" for a sundowner.

The dive is part of a much longer six-month Ring of Fire expedition EYOS and Caladan Oceanic are operating, a followup to the Five Deeps Expedition made last year, which visited cavernous chasms in the Pacific, Indian, Southern, Arctic and Atlantic oceans over a period of 10 months.

"Its collective mission is to verify and test the deepest points possible, collect and analyze scientific samples, and extend humankind's knowledge of the most extreme environment on Earth, says Ben Lyons, EYOS Expeditions' CEO. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
(CNN) — Israeli scientists have brewed beer from a 5,000-year-old strain of yeast -- and apparently it tastes pretty fruity.

The University of Jerusalem's Ronen Hazan and Yuval Gadot had the idea to reactivate the yeast, which was recovered from clay pots found at the nearby Tell es Safi/Gath archaeological site.

The site is believed to be the ancient city of Gath, home to the Philistine people.

It's said to be the hometown of the giant Goliath, who -- according to the Bible -- was defeated in battle by the boy David.

Says Hazan, "I thought, wow, that's kind of a miracle that the yeast survived thousands of years in these pots. Amazing."

The beer took eight weeks to ferment, which is fairly speedy considering the yeast has been prepped for millennia.

One taste-tester described the beer as "really interesting" and "fruity like nut and bananas." Another claimed that it was "tasty" and "unique" and "going down like oil."

Not everyone was a fan, though. One person who tried the ancient beer concluded, "It tastes like burned bread."

Yeast can impart 500 different flavors and aromas to beers and is very good at surviving the ages.

Some researchers say ancient Egyptians began brewing beer as early as 5,500 BCE.

But it was also being brewed in Mesopotamia, now Western Asia, where people may have used straws to drink it. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) — Egypt is most known for its Great Pyramid of Giza or for luxury resorts on both the Mediterranean and the Red Sea.

Often overlooked is one of the country's most spectacular landscapes, White Desert National Park.

The sprawling protectorate in the Farafra depression in western Egypt is a treasure trove of wonderment.

People touring these strange lands have often felt like they're visiting another planet, despite only being a five-hour drive from Cairo.

Trips to Egypt's Western Desert have been rising in popularity among locals and tourists alike.

Activities range from dune bashing and sandboarding to mountain biking and kayaking in the nearby Bahariya Oasis.

"The White Desert is so different from any place on the planet," Ziad Omran, co-founder of the adventure travel company Destination 31 , told CNN Travel earlier this year.

"Once they experience adventure travel there, they end up coming back again with their friends. So, they can experience it for themselves."

Black Desert

l e v a r t

The journey to the White Desert usually starts with a stop at an utterly contrasting landscape -- the Black Desert.

This desert features a myriad of unique mountain ranges. Each one carries a coat of black stones thrown out of volcanoes millions of years ago, giving the sandy landscape its colored name.

After hiking up one of the peaks, it becomes clear that this area is devoid of any sign of life apart from a single road that stretches into the distance.

However, that isn't the road that leads to the White Desert.

Reaching the national park requires deflating the tires of a 4x4 Land Cruiser and dune bashing across the desert at dizzying angles.

Zigzagging and racing down rolling dunes is a heart-pounding experience that eventually gives way to the instantly breathtaking view of the White Desert.

Within seconds of arriving, questions surrounding its mysterious origins arise as its eerie beauty provides a staunch reminder that our planet is subject to powerful climate changes.

It's completely mind-blowing to believe that this was once a sea or an ocean and that the only evidence remaining is a collection of calcified limestone rocks sculpted over time by sand and wind.

These chalky abstract shapes seemingly change their color depending on the time of day, shifting from brilliant white to creamy, then reaching a golden brown.

When darkness falls

Nestled between the massive rock formations in the Valley of Agabat is a soft sandy hill that's perfect for sand boarding.

Harder to carve and slower than riding down a snowy mountain, sand boarding still delivers a thrill, but there are no ski lifts in the desert and climbing up a steep sandy hill is exhausting.

As the sun sets, the desert reminds everyone that this is a land of extremes and every hour since the sun's departure requires putting on a few additional layers of warmth.

After setting up camp, the local Bedouins prepare for visitors an authentic traditional dinner over an open fire.

The exotic aroma of the feast often draws attention from one of the rare residents of the White Desert -- the fennec fox, also known as the sand fox.

These adorably harmless animals are hard to spot, appearing as shadowy silhouettes in the distance. They often approach campsites as they're accustomed to counting on visitors' leftovers as part of their diet.

Because of the depth of the landscape and zero light pollution in any direction, the stars shine and streak across the sky at night. This marvelous scene is arguably one of the best environments on the planet to observe the Milky Way in all its splendor.

When the moon emerges, its brilliant light reflects off the rocky surfaces giving a blueish glow that illuminates the national park and invites nocturnal wandering across its otherworldly terrain.

Nighttime explorers need to be wary and bring a flashlight as it's easy to get lost or trip up on the bumpy alien topography.

In the morning, the rising sun wakes up even the heaviest sleeper. Before packing up camp, it's worth taking a hike to one of the park's treasured sculptures aptly known, because of its shape, as the Chicken and Mushroom.

After leaving the park, most adventurers travel just over an hour away to the Bahariya Oasis.

A popular attraction in the area is to climb atop the English mountain, so named because of the ruins of a British World War I outpost that crowns its highest peak.

Reaching the top provides a spectacular 360-degree view overlooking the entire oasis, including the lush forests of delicious dates and olive trees. It also presents a challenging ride for mountain biking enthusiasts.

Cycling down its winding paths littered with loose jagged rocks and sandy patches is not for the faint-hearted but provides those with experience an exhilarating trail.

The bottom of the mountain leads into the pristine and untouched Bahariya Salt Lake. Incredibly, there's no development around its shores, making the calm, therapeutic lake an excellent place for kayakers to catch a majestic sunset.

"My favorite part of the trip was kayaking with the golden rays bouncing off the water. It was a moment of pure wonder," Noreen Fadel, one of the adventurers on a recent Destination 31 trip, shared with CNN Travel.

All these sights and activities can fit into a two or three-day trip. The longer the stay, the more time to explore the surrounding area as there are numerous attractions in the region that deserve attention. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
(CNN) — Movie theaters around the world have closed amid the coronavirus outbreak and the need for social distancing to stop the spread and flatten the curve.

Fortunately, there's never been a better time to catch up on classic oldies and cherished favorites.

Since we're all more or less house-bound with a walk here or there thrown in for good measure (and mental health), the CNN Travel team is traveling via our favorite wanderlust films.

No, watching "Romancing the Stone" is not the same as going to Cartegena (Colombia has changed a lot since Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner traipsed through it in the 1984 rom-com).

Nor will tuning into 2001's "Y Tu Mamá También" make you think you're actually on a road trip in Mexico and not on your couch in Brooklyn, but great films do have something in common: the power to transport.

Below, read our picks for best travel movies that take you along for the ride:

'Barcelona' (1994)

In 1994's "Barcelona," the Spanish city, acting as backdrop to the tangled love lives of a feckless American naval officer and his highly strung cousin, looks like pure heaven. Mary Evans/Castle Rock Entertainment/Ronald Grant/Everett Collection

This may look like a period piece from the early 1990s, but director Whit Stillman's witty, wordy comedy about foreigners abroad stands the test of time -- not least because the appeal of the movie's main star, gorgeous Barcelona, is utterly timeless.

The Spanish city, acting as backdrop to the tangled love lives of a feckless American naval officer and his highly strung cousin, looks like pure heaven.

Warm nights, amazing architecture, sunshine, cafes, bars, parties, conversation, coastal escapes and beautiful people. The movie also presents possibly the best argument ever for falling in love with someone of a different nationality.

"What's really terrific is that when we act in ways which might objectively be considered incredibly obnoxious or annoying," ruminates newly married lead character Ted, "They don't get upset at all, they don't take it personally, they just assume it's some national characteristic." -- Barry Neild

'Thelma and Louise' (1991)

It was the movie that catapulted Brad Pitt to rock-star status, and true, there's a lot to dissect in the now-infamous roadside motel scene, where a hair dryer is much more than a styling tool. But Pitt is not the star of this film.

"Thelma and Louise," at its core, is a tale of female friendship, and the screen is dominated by the film's two lead females: Thelma (Geena Davis in a career-defining role) and Louise (Susan Sarandon, tough as nails and defiant from the get-go).

The pals from small-town Arkansas hit the road on a weekend quest in search of fun and freedom from their jobs, their men and their boredom. When the carefree adventure takes a dark left turn, Thelma and Louise bind together, demonstrating the lengths women will go to save each other.

The car chase scenes offer a fresh, new perspective with the women behind the wheel of a 1966 Ford Thunderbird, owning the open desert road.

Filmed in California and Utah with the best Grand Canyon scenes filmed south of Dead Horse Point State Park, watch "Thelma and Louise" if you've never been out West and watch it if you have and yearn to return.

It'll take you on one hell of a road trip with a devastating conclusion. Hey, maybe staying in isn't so terrible after all. -- Stacey Lastoe

'Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone' (2001)

Locations in "Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone" are inspired by real places, as graduates of English private schools (called public school in the UK) will tell you. Warner Bros.

When Harry Potter runs through a column at King's Cross railway station in London to get to Platform 9 3/4, we know it isn't real — that magical station to another place that isn't actually free of human worry or tragedy. And yet we want to visit.

We've gotten close at The Wizarding World of Harry Potter at Universal Orlando Resort in Florida, where my Ravenclaw got onto the platform to catch the train, found the right wand at Ollivanders and had a glass of butter beer.

The movie's locations are inspired by real places, as graduates of English private schools (called public school in the UK) will tell you: Black robes for formal hall dinners, darting down narrow old streets to visit tea houses and sandwich shops, discovering books that are hundreds of years old (perhaps under glass at the Tate).

Preliminary discussions for a London trip to do the studio tour, visit King's Cross and catch a Shakespeare play are on hold for now, so we'll make some tea and scones and settle into another viewing. -- Katia Hetter

'Grand Budapest Hotel' (2014)

Set in a luxury ski resort in the fictional East European Republic of Zubrowka in the 1930s, "Grand Budapest Hotel" is anchored by a murder investigation peppered with stolen art, prison escapes and a secret concierge society. Fox Searchlight Pictures

One of the most satisfying films of director Wes Anderson's oeuvre, "Grand Budapest Hotel" is a wonderfully bizarre tale interwoven with whimsical backdrops, colorful characters and plenty of delicious, dark comedy.

Set in a luxury ski resort in the fictional East European Republic of Zubrowka in the 1930s, the plot is anchored by a murder investigation peppered with stolen art, prison escapes and a secret concierge society.

Concierge Gustave H. -- a role played to perfection by Ralph Fiennes -- is at the center of this madcap adventure, and he's got a weak spot for hotel guests who tick a few key boxes: wealthy, old and female.

"You're looking so well darling, you really are," he says to one of his departed guests-with-benefits. "They've done a marvelous job. I don't know what sort of cream they've put on you down at the morgue, but I want some."

Though the hotel doesn't actually exist, much of the film was shot in the beautiful German town of Goerlitz, famed for its medieval streets. -- Karla Cripps

'The Razor's Edge' (1946 and 1984)

"The Razor's Edge," has been twice adapted from the epic W. Somerset Maugham novel about a man's search for the meaning of life.

Like the book, the films follow the main character, Larry Darrell, from the Chicago suburbs to the European battlefront of WWI, the coal mines of the UK, the streets of Paris and on to India and up into the Himalayas.

It's as much a geographic adventure as it is an inner, spiritual one. Of the two adaptations, I prefer the 1984 Bill Murray version.

The book was his favorite and Murray agreed to make some movie his friend Dan Aykroyd wrote about ghost hunters, only if the same studio would make "The Razor's Edge" first. They did.

And even though it was a box office dud, watching the film always inspires me to see the world but also uncover something deeper in it. -- David G. Allan

'The Trip to Italy' (2014)

Enjoy a mental escape to the gorgeous Italian countryside with the witty Rob Brydon (left) and Steve Coogan in one of the top buddies-take-a-trip films of all time. Everett Collection

The plot of "The Trip to Italy" is not really a plot at all.

In this film, you're a fifth wheel tagging along on an extraordinary road trip with two old actor friends from the UK, Englishman Steve Coogan and the Welsh Rob Brydon, playing fictionalized versions of their famous personas.

The route is from Piedmont via Rome to Amalfi, back to Naples and finally the tony island of Capri. Retracing the footsteps of romantic poets Byron and Shelley, they drive a convertible Mini Cooper through breathtaking country and alongside harrowing seaside cliffs.

The goal of the trip is, as Brydon says, "beautiful countryside, beautiful wine, beautiful women, beautiful food."

When you're not belly laughing at their impressions and mutual insults, you'll feel a surprising sense of melancholy and loss of youth as the leads wrestle with their own mortality.

The contrast of this palpable emotion with the magnificent setting is what makes this movie truly special. And the fact is you can actually take this trip yourself one day -- from ordering the tagliatelle with meat ragout at Trattoria della Posta in Alba to enjoying a "very Jules Verne" (quoting Coogan) seafood lunch on the sea-view terrace at La Cantina in San Fruttuoso.

What Coogan says about a bite of pasta could also be applied to the film itself, "This is as good as it gets." -- Brekke Fletcher

'Easy Rider' (1969)

Get your motor running and head out on the highway with Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper, who set out on a different great American road trip fueled by sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll.

This low-budget motorcycle film helped usher in a cinematic era of gritty realism set to popular, topical music (notably Steppenwolf's "Born to be Wild"). This is about as opposite of 1956's big-budget "Around the World in 80 Days" as you can get.

The two antiheroes take a West-to-East journey from California to New Orleans to catch Mardi Gras. Watch the American landscape transition from the desolate beauty of the desert Southwest to the lush greenery of Louisiana's Gulf Coast. The only thing that stays the same is America's seedy underbelly.

The trippy LSD sequence in New Orleans' St. Louis Cemetery No. 1 -- filmed without permission by the way -- is especially memorable.

This is a good escape until we can once again go out looking for adventure and whatever comes our way . -- Forrest Brown

'The Lizzie McGuire Movie' (2003)

While considering what film to pick, I debated the sun-soaked north Italian vistas of 2017's "Call Me By Your Name" or the dreamy Vienna strolls in 1995's "Before Sunrise."

But I think the ultimate cinematic balm is pure, unburdened-by-constraints-of-reality escapism, so I'm recommending millennial-favorite "The Lizzie McGuire Movie."

Here, American teenager Lizzie (Hilary Duff) is mistaken for a famous Italian pop star on a school trip to Rome.

What follows is a whirlwind, moped tour of the Italian capital's best sites, starting with (what else) a coin tossed into the Trevi Fountain and ending with naturally an iconic pop performance at the city's Colosseum. The film owes its basic premise to "Roman Holiday" (another CNN Travel recommendation) but there's a happier ending here.

And how could there not be? Lizzie and her friends are inexplicably staying in what appears to be a five-star hotel, her high school principal is played by comic genius Alex Borstein and viewers can revel in the comeuppance of would-be-love-interest-turned-backstabbing-lip-syncer Paolo ("Sing to me Paolo!")

If you didn't grow up watching this, you might be a bit bemused, but it's charming, sweet, and Rome glows.

Plus, we might be getting more Lizzie in the future (a revival's in the works), so why not catch up on the story so far? -- Francesca Street

'The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel' (2011)

With this semi-lockdown thing going on in New York City, I originally wanted to suggest "Wild," a movie where Reese Witherspoon attempts to master the Pacific Crest Trail all while figuring out her life and learning what it means to be utterly alone in the world. Errr. No.

Instead, I offer "The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel," a movie that reminds us that traveling offers an opportunity to add a whole lot of color to our otherwise gray lives. May we all see those rainbows again someday.

Judi Dench, Bill Nighy, Maggie Smith and friends play a bunch of British retirees (or pensioners) who move to a zany new kind of senior home in Rajasthan, India.

The owner, played by Dev Patel, has promised them a luxury hotel and endless possibilities, but the reality is a crumbling palace, heat and more heat. Those promised possibilities, however, do present themselves and mad romantic adventure entangles nearly everyone.

The movie is a joy, the audiences loved it, and the $10 million-dollar budget movie grossed $137 million and inspired a sequel. -- Channon Hodge

If ever an opening scene were to establish the sublime ferocity of nature and humanity's humble role within, it's the wide shot that introduces German adventurer-director Werner Herzog's 1972 epic "Aguirre, Wrath of God."

An immense mountainside stands half-shrouded in cloud, a distant thread of movement troubling its sheer cliffs. Slowly, as the camera moves, we spot the people, an antlike column of Spanish 16th-century conquistadores trudging down ancient Inca steps in search of El Dorado, the legendary city of gold.

Filmed on location in the Peruvian rainforest on the Amazon River, close to Machu Picchu, the landscape is a key character in this feverish tale of hubris and human folly.

Equal parts bittersweet and enchanting, 1953 fairy tale "Roman Holiday" features a doe-eyed princess (Audrey Hepburn) and a dashing newspaperman (Gregory Peck) in a romantic caper that has them strolling the Spanish Steps and ripping through the streets of Rome on a Vespa.

In a time when those streets are eerily quiet, the film might serve as a reminder that they will eventually spring to life again.

(CNN) — Once upon a time, reaching the highest peak on Earth was considered a feat achievable only by a select few.

Fast forward to today.

Though it remains a costly endeavor -- and sometimes deadly -- it's logistically easy enough to arrange. Over 4,000 adventurers have climbed to the top of Mount Everest, according to the British Mountaineering Council

So what's an intrepid amateur explorer with a thirst for all things rare and superlative to do?

Travel in the opposite direction, of course, to Challenger Deep. Sitting at a depth of 10,928 meters (35,853 feet), it's widely believed to be the deepest point in the world's oceans.

In a world-first, travel company EYOS Expeditions has teamed with private undersea diving company Caladan Oceanic to offer general members of the public an opportunity to join an upcoming expedition and dive to the bottom of the Marianas Trench in the western Pacific Ocean.

How rare is this experience? According to EYOS, only seven people on earth have visited Challenger Deep. (Hollywood director James Cameron just happens to be one of them.)

Here's the catch: The company is only inviting three people to join the trip. Staff tell CNN Travel it's being offered on a first-come, first-serve basis. The cost?

US$750,000.

Four hours on the sea floor

The three travelers, called "Mission Specialists," will spend approximately eight days with the Ring of Fire Expedition, which is operated by EYOS and Caladan Oceanic.

Each submarine dive will take up to 14 hours. The descent, which is over seven miles, takes over four hours. The divers will spend up to four hours on the seafloor, where they will get to explore and potentially film their surroundings.

"This is the most exclusive destination on Earth," says Rob McCallum, founding partner of EYOS Expeditions, in a statement.

"Currently, only three manned expeditions have ever been made to the bottom of Challenger Deep and more people have been to the moon than to the bottom of the ocean."

The Mission Specialists will board the hadal exploration vessel, DSSV Pressure Drop, in June 2020 -- EYOS says the exact date is to be confirmed -- in Agat, Guam. It then takes a day at sea to reach the Marianas Trench.

The expedition will use Caladan Oceanic's submersible, Limiting Factor, which has been pressure tested in a chamber to 14,000 meters and has already dived five times to the bottom of the Mariana Trench. EYOS says it's the only vehicle ever constructed that is capable of multiple dives to full ocean depth.

"The occupants of the submersible are completely protected by the 90mm thick titanium sphere and experience no pressure changes or physiological stresses at all," says the statement announcing the trip.

Comfy seats, hi-def cameras

As a result, no formal pre-departure training is required, though Mission Specialists will receive a comprehensive shipboard and sub orientation as part of pre-dive preparations.

"The inside of the sub is quiet, peaceful and very relaxing. The sub has two comfortable seats, three view ports, and high-definition 'surround' cameras," says McCallum.

"Whilst onboard, Mission Specialists will be fully integrated members of the team and free to work alongside our sonar operator/ocean mappers, submersible technicians, film production team, expedition management and ship's officers to gain an insight into the complexities and challenges of hadal exploration," he says.

Don't worry. Even intrepid explorers need some down-time, too. McCallum says when not diving, expedition members can relax by taking in a movie, going to the gym, reading, or heading up to the "Sky Bar" for a sundowner.

The dive is part of a much longer six-month Ring of Fire expedition EYOS and Caladan Oceanic are operating, a followup to the Five Deeps Expedition made last year, which visited cavernous chasms in the Pacific, Indian, Southern, Arctic and Atlantic oceans over a period of 10 months.

"Its collective mission is to verify and test the deepest points possible, collect and analyze scientific samples, and extend humankind's knowledge of the most extreme environment on Earth, says Ben Lyons, EYOS Expeditions' CEO. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) — Rob Atthill says he was "smitten" by Vietnamese coffee the first time he visited the Southeast Asian nation, in 2004.

A pioneer of the Vietnamese street food scene in London, Atthill started importing coffee -- grown by farmers in the country's Central Highlands and roasted in Ho Chi Minh City -- two years later. He says coffee sales, through his company Ca Phe VN , have tripled in the last five years.

Vietnam is the world's second largest exporter of coffee (after Brazil).

The drink is also extremely popular at home, where it was first introduced by French colonists in the 1850s.

For the Vietnamese, coffee provides much more than just a shot of energy -- it's a way of life. Coffee outlets range from hole-in-the-wall counters with plastic stools on the sidewalk, to sleek, contemporary cafes with roasters on the premises.

"It's about getting together with friends," says Will Frith, a coffee consultant who owns a co-roasting enterprise in Ho Chi Minh City. He says coffee drinkers tend to gather in their favorite coffee shops, which operate as "a third space," outside the home and workplace, and often form friendships with the owners and staff. Additionally, "nearly every Vietnamese household makes coffee at home," he says.

Coffee cherries are harvested -- usually by hand -- between November and February. Shutterstock

But despite the size of its export sales, and its vibrant local coffee culture, Vietnam has not gained a reputation as a source of quality coffee. And that's because of the beans.

The majority of Vietnam's coffee beans -- around 97% -- are the robusta variety.

Known for their bold, earthy, bitter flavor, and high caffeine content, robusta beans are typically used to make cheap, mass-market products, including instant coffee and supermarket blends.

Bulk business has given them a bad reputation in the high-end, specialty coffee market. Coffee connoisseurs usually opt for arabica beans, which have less caffeine, higher acidity, and a lighter, sweeter flavor.

Atthill says this attitude is outdated: "There's a lot of snobbery against robusta in the coffee industry ... but there's no inferiority. Arabica is not inherently better."

What matters, Atthill says, is the quality of the beans.

"There's high quality robusta and poor quality arabica."

Ca Phe VN's house blend, which Atthill describes as "nutty, chocolatey, strong but approachable" accounts for 90% of his sales. The blend combines 85% robusta beans, which provide body and flavor, with a dash of arabica, which adds acidity, complexity and aroma, he says.

Sahra Nguyen launched Nguyen Coffee Supply in Brooklyn, New York, in 2018. She buys coffee beans from a family-run farm in Vietnam's Central Highlands and roasts them herself.

Like Atthill, Nguyen wants to transform the reputation of the unfairly maligned robusta bean. She recently added Grit -- a 100% robusta product -- to her range, and has conducted blind taste tests in which customers sample Grit alongside two of her other coffees: Loyalty -- made from 50% robusta and 50% arabica beans; and Courage, which is 100% arabica.

Overall, more than three quarters of testers preferred Grit. The response "blew me away," says Nguyen.

Vietnamese coffee has also returned to its roots in France. Husband-and-wife team, Nam and Linh Nguyen, opened Hanoi Corner in central Paris two years ago. Along with coffee, the café offers Vietnamese tea, cakes and streetfood staples.

Vietnam has "a unique coffee culture" says Nam Nguyen, an award-winning barista. "We wanted to introduce it in France ... where nobody knows it," he says.

At the same time, specialty coffee is gaining influence back home.

Frith says a new generation of Vietnamese coffee roasters and cafe entrepreneurs are focusing on quality -- paying attention to terroir, discussing cultivation methods with farmers and adopting best practices when it comes to processing techniques.

In the last few years, a trend towards sophisticated interior design has added to the buzz, especially in Ho Chi Minh City, where he lives.

"Coffee shops here are becoming as diverse and fancy as anything you'd find in London or New York," he says.

What's on the menu?

In Vietnam, you can have a lot more added to your coffee besides milk and sugar. Here are some of the popular concoctions on offer:

Garzón, Uruguay (CNN) — Terraced vines and spindly olive trees form a patchwork quilt over gently rolling hills, which are themselves covered by a maze of powdery dirt roads. Follow one of these bumpy paths far enough and you'll find an olive oil mill, a farm-to-table restaurant and a hilltop winery.

In fact, if you squint a bit, this place could pass for the famed Italian wine region of Tuscany -- that is, if you can overlook the wild capybaras (the world's largest rodents) and ostrich-like rheas running through the vines. These creatures, of course, are telltale signs you're in a totally different hemisphere on a completely different continent: South America.

It's not that South American wines aren't well known. When experts in California, France or Italy discuss fine wines from South America they typically reference two countries: Chile and Argentina.

Chile revived the lost French grape of Carménère and with it, fashioned Bordeaux blends that now rival those from the Old World. Meanwhile, Argentina spearheaded a global craze for Malbec that gave the varietal a permanent home on wine shelves the planet over.

Yet, there's another player that's slowly built up momentum in recent years, thanks, in no small part, to a pioneering new winery that's experimenting with grape varietals and dismantling regional stereotypes.

The country is Uruguay, and the winery is Bodega Garzón

This really is wine country

Garzón lies inland from the fashionable beach town of José Ignacio, about three hours east of the capital Montevideo. The vines here are barely a decade old, but that hasn't stopped Garzón from racking up an impressive list of accolades.

Suddenly, the world is beginning to give South America's neglected stepchild a closer look.

Uruguay has a 150-year-long history of winemaking, but it's always struggled to get the kind of attention that its neighbors have received for decades.

Size may play a part. South America's second-smallest nation has historically had a wine industry that's slight in scale, miniscule in exports and iffy on quality.

Bodega Garzón is out to change that -- but it hasn't always been easy.

It's on South America's Atlantic Coast

Christian Wylie, the winery's managing director, says one of the biggest hurdles is its location: Many consumers don't even know where Uruguay is. (Hint: it's between Argentina and Brazil on South America's Atlantic Coast.)

"When we have tastings of Garzón wine around the world, one of the first things we do is show them a map," he says. "We explain that Uruguay is at the same latitude as wine regions in Chile, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa."

In other words, the conditions are there to make great wine.

What makes Bodega Garzón so different from nearly every other winery in its own country is that it's located just 11 miles (18 kilometers) from the Atlantic Ocean.

Not only that, it's in an area that was, historically, little more than pasture for cows. (Uruguayans eat more beef, per capita, than any other country on Earth. Take that Argentina.)

Owner Alejandro Bulgheroni, a billionaire businessman from Argentina, planned to use this land for a wind farm thanks to its cool Atlantic breezes. His wife, Bettina, was concerned about the aesthetics (they have a house nearby) and convinced him to try grapes instead.

Local ocean-influenced wines

That's why Bulgheroni hired the renowned Italian oenologist Alberto Antonini to survey the rolling granitic hills and assess if they might be suitable for vines.

Just over a decade later, the pair has almost single-handedly created a 524-acre wine region while inspiring a local movement in ocean-influenced wines.

Uruguay has about 22,250 acres (about 9,000 hectares) under vine.

Most vineyards face the River Plate in Canelones Department, "but I don't believe that's the best location," says Antonini. "It's just the closest to Montevideo, where the first European immigrants arrived."

In Garzón, Antonini and Bulgheroni believe they've stumbled across a new frontier for South American wines.

And Bulgheroni still figured out a way to use wind power.

Although his renewable energy project here might never have materialized, he's helped turn this place into the first winery in the world to achieve LEED silver certification for its entire facility, in part, thanks to the way it harnesses wind power. (Developed by the non-profit US Green Building Council, LEED assesses the potential environmental impacts and human benefits of a project.)

The winery's sustainable design includes headline-making features such as the largest green roof with native species in Latin America. The structure, conceived by Mendoza-based architecture firm Bórmida & Yanzón, was also built into hills and over natural terraces to utilize a gravity flow system for the production of its wines.

Though the winery itself didn't open until 2016, it now lures 20,000 visitors a year to the tiny town of Pueblo Garzón (population 200).

Most come for tours that dip underground into caves filled with barrels, steel tanks and concrete "eggs" (the ovular cement tanks that are suddenly all the rage with winemakers). You can also skirt past the abstract sculptural pieces of Uruguayan artist Pablo Atchugarry to tour the production line, which is capable of turning out 200,000 cases annually (though current production is around 110,000 cases).

A posh private club, commercial olive oil mill and 120-seat restaurant led by celebrity chef Francis Mallmann (whose primal technique of open-fire cooking featured on the Netflix series "Chef's Table") keep visitors lingering far longer than they might expect.

Part of Bodega Garzón's success in producing fine wine has been selecting varietals that will grow well in Uruguay's hot and humid climate.

Tannat, a highly tannic red wine varietal from the south of France, was already Uruguay's signature grape long before Garzón arrived on the scene. It was a given.

However, the Galician white wine varietal of Albariño has proved to be one of Garzón's biggest surprises, winning awards for its freshness, minerality and round finish. The winery also gives the Bordeaux blending grape Cabernet Franc a starring turn as a single varietal, highlighting its soft tannins and peppery punch.

The icon wine, Balasto, is a blend of Tannat, Cabernet Frac, Merlot and Marselan. Its name is an homage to the weathered granite found in the soil at Garzón, which allows for drainage during the area's wetter months and keeps the wines here lively, rather than heavy.

Balasto spends 20 months in untoasted French oak barrels and retails for around $100 in the US, reaching a price point few Uruguayan wines could demand a decade ago. It is, perhaps, the most obvious sign that Uruguay has finally broken-down historic barriers that have kept it from becoming a major player in the wine world. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
(CNN) — A "mawage" between an upscale bar and the film "The Princess Bride" is what "bwings" fans of the film "togever" today. (For those not in the know, check out the movie's wedding scene.)

The Sixth Bar in Chicago is paying homage to one of the most beloved films of the '80s. The As You Wish pop-up , which opened on February 11, is a love letter to "The Princess Bride."

Though not an initial box office success, the film has become a cult classic, is eminently quotable and was inducted into the National Film Registry for being "culturally significant."

The name of the bar comes from the oft-repeated line in the movie when Princess Buttercup (Robin Wright) instructs Westley (Cary Elwes) to do something and he always complies and answers, "As you wish."

The As You Wish pop-up bar is designed by The Fifty/50 Restaurant Group marketing director and super-fan Sarah Zelman. Sarah Zelman/The Sixth

"For us, being fans of this movie, we just wanted to execute it in one of our best spaces we have, make it as fully immersive as possible in the decor and have the drinks to be inventive, playful, fun and match everything," said Dave Andrews, a spokesman for the Fifty/50 Restaurant Group, which includes The Sixth.

The space is decorated with thrones, bejeweled tiaras, trailing flowers and vines, in addition to production stills and life-size cutouts of the characters ready for the perfect selfie.

Some seating areas are decorated as odes to characters including Westley, Inigo Montoya, Vizzini and Fezzik.

"Having a fully immersive experience is what makes people happy. Heavy Easter eggs around one-off things from the movie that aren't super mainstream and people are into and are nods to those things make people really happy as well."

Inside As You Wish

Walking into the bar, guests are greeted with a logo featuring Buttercup and Westley holding a cocktail, created by Fifty/50 Restaurant Group marketing director and pop-up concept designer Sarah Zelman (who's also a superfan).

Further into the bar, patrons can walk on fake grass, which is surrounded by large installations on the walls that tell the beginning of the story.

"If you remember in the movie, the grandpa starts reading the book to his grandson, so the first thing you see are those seven lines of the movie and the first area is kind of alluding to the farm area where there's rolling hills and it's very British countryside," Zelman said.

"That's where the story kind of starts. That's also where our Princess Buttercup, Westley and Fezzik live. Each of those have their own respective quotes on them."

The menu features "The Kissing Book" and "Inconceivable" among the 16 themed cocktails.

The Kissing Book combines gin with ginger, cherry and cranberry tonic, while the Inconceivable mixes aperol, tequila, green chartreuse, oyster tincture and strawberry-jalapeno cordial, plus a chocolate-covered strawberry.

Even the ice cubes are themed: Laminated images of scenes from the film are frozen inside of them.

A timeless experience

Although "The Princess Bride" was released 33 years ago, its impact has spanned generations.

"I think that's another thing that makes [the movie] really special -- it's not just one demographic or one ten-year window of people who had this as a big part of their childhood," Zelman said. "It's everybody from the time the movie came out until now."

Some couples have celebrated their anniversaries and other important moments there. Kids bring their parents because they know "The Princess Bride" is one of their favorite movies. "We had one person who said, 'I used one of those quotes in my vows," Zelman said.

"My favorite thing that I've seen is people coming [in character costumes]," Zelman said. I just feel honored that people are appreciating it this much because I did work really hard on it and I tried to stay true to the movie."

As You Wish is the follow-up to The Sixth's "Yippee Ki-Yay" -- a "Die Hard"-inspired Christmas pop-up bar .

It is open evenings to early mornings every day for the remainder of its run, ending March 22. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
(CNN) — For decades, humans have ripped up the natural landscape in Asia, chopping down trees to build luxury resorts in the most beautiful locations and caging wild animals to attract tourists.

Bangkok-based hotel architect Bill Bensley is saying "no more."

When a client approached him about designing a resort that included a zoo in Wuchuan, in southern China's Guangdong province, he flipped the idea on its head: let's cage the humans and let the exotic and endangered animals roam free.

Sounds crazy? Bensley is known for maverick ideas, so much so that he's been called the "Willy Wonka of hotel design."

At his Shinta Mani Wild resort in Cambodia guests arrive via a 380-meter zipwire over the wilderness of the South Cardamom National Park and are invited to join Wildlife Alliance anti-poaching patrols.

But he's not doing things simply for the shock factor. Bensley is a lifelong conservationist who deeply cares about what humans are doing to the planet. He's fortunate that his aptitude for design means wealthy and traditional hotel chains want a slice of his unique eco-focused creativity.

Speaking from a cafe in London's five-star Rosewood hotel, 61-year-old Bensley says the first phase of the eight-year WorldWild project, which will consist of several different top branded hotels, is expected to open in 2023.

The cages for humans will actually be 2,400 hotel rooms, with a budget of generally a million dollars per room. Let's just say the guests won't be slumming it.

However, it's not the rooms the California-native is buzzing over. He's stoked that following a meeting with the head of Southern China's Communist Party "and his entourage of 47 people," he has tacit approval on the idea of relocating abused animals from zoos all over China, to be released onto the roughly 2,000-hectare piece of land where the human zoo will be located.

"It's very complex and it's also very political," Bensley says. Right now the land is a big duck farm.

"It was on a migratory path for birds going from the Beijing area down to Australia, now we are reinstating the wetlands for them to fly through and fuel up," he explains.

To help make his vision a reality, Bensley has hired a full-time zoologist. A glimpse of his gloriously illustrated "overall masterplan" shows how the reserve will feature individual Asia, Africa and Australia savannahs for animals to live in their "natural habitats."

Rewilding

Zoologist James Morrison and Bensley's list of species for WorldWild is based on animals that provide the best conservation value and have the highest need: those currently in roadside zoos or the illegal wildlife trade in China -- with pangolins atop the list.

The scale-covered, house cat-sized nocturnal mammal, sometimes eaten as a delicacy in China and Vietnam and used in traditional medicines, is among the most trafficked animals in the world. The Chinese pangolin, one of eight types, is listed by the International Union for Conservation as "critically endangered," one step above being extinct in the wild.

Morrison fears the Asian species could be wiped out imminently and efforts may be focused on conserving African pangolins instead. It doesn't help that the animal's natural defense is to roll into a ball to protect itself from predators -- but for poachers, this just makes it easier to catch one and put it in a bag.

It's likely animals arriving at WorldWild will be "pretty emotionally scarred" but part of the meaning of the project is that people will see animals be rehabilitated, Morrison adds.

There will be disease screening at the animal arrival and rehab center for the dozens of animals they hope to rescue, including Asian golden snub-nosed monkeys, Chinese forest musk deer, elongated tortoises, white rhinos and Australian snapping turtles.

WorldWild will have exhibitions on the illegal wildlife trade and experiences such as tree top walks through a dense monkey forest and an Indigenous Australian rock painting.

Animals get access to 95% of the land, and humans the remaining 5% -- in hotels by Waldorf Astoria, the Hilton and Bensley's own Shinta Mani collection.

Changing minds

CNN goes inside the Bangkok studio of Bill Bensley, the creative mind behind some of the world's most incredible luxury resorts.

Bensley is aware China is a tough place to fight for wild animals -- especially with the powerful Chinese traditional medicine associations wanting to protect their multi-billion-dollar industry -- but with a population of more than 1.3 billion it's also somewhere he could have a tremendous impact.

"My primary reason for doing this is to educate as many Chinese as we possibly can," he says.

"That's the idea and the government is totally behind it, which is great."

He has set himself a target of changing "10 million Chinese opinions a year" and this means the gates of the human zoo will be open to more than just "rich Four Seasons" customers. He wants a 99% Chinese customer base.

As a man who rallies against hotel "greenwashing" and recently published a sustainability white paper for the hotel industry, he is honest about the dichotomy of asking people to fly to the remote, luxury resorts he designs.

"Yeah we are [asking people to travel], and we shouldn't be," Bensley says.

According to the European Investment Bank's climate survey, which gauges how citizens feel about climate change, 75% of Europeans intend to fly less in 2020. This figure increases to 94% in China.

"I think the future is going to be more like the human zoo project. It's on the high speed train," Bensley forecasts.

Around the park he has also planned four different trains -- named on the masterplan as: Oriental Expresso, Tasmanian Tiger, Iron Horse and Africa Queen.

One train will service seven different whistle stops, each with a theater that's aimed at 10-15-year-old children.

"It's a theater that says things that will hit them in the heart as far as the value of wilderness, the value of wildlife, because in the Chinese language today they are a thing, to be eaten, to be owned," Bensley argues.

He concedes that asking someone to fly from, for example, Glasgow, Scotland, to stay at his 15-tent Shinta Mani Wild luxury eco-camp resort in Cambodia is not "environmentally great." However, he reasons, if he hadn't bought the corridor of rainforest -- the size of Central Park -- where it's situated 10 years ago "it would be a titanium mine now."

He hopes overseas visitors go home and spread the word about using hospitality to conserve areas that would not otherwise be conserved.

Mitigating damage

Bensley says he believes "everyone has a part to play" in climate change, with young people and their social media accounts holding huge power when it comes to shaping the future of sustainable travel.

And Instagram travelers can be a force for good when they avoid over-touristed areas and instead turn their filtered lens to places that need attention, like in Cambodia where the government is "finally starting to realize that the rainforest is something of value that people want to see instead of cutting it down and making a profit selling that wood to China," Bensley says.

The architect published his Sensible Sustainability Solutions white paper in January, sparked by a realization that as an approved designer for luxury chains he has signed countless non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) on hotel building standards and not a single one of the 300-400 page documents that lay out how a hotel should be built has sustainability written into it.

"It's a very small old boys club if you will, and for me to come out and call bulls**t on all of these I'm in danger of losing some contracts. But I don't care because it's the right thing to do," Bensley says.

Watering hole for humans: Plans for a Hilton Colony Lodge hotel with a 'mwamba' swimming pool see it set in the African savannah area of the reserve. BENSLEY

Many of the 20 suggestions in his open-source white paper are drawn from designing more than 200 high-end hotels in 27 countries.

For example, eradicating energy guzzling aircon and using cross ventilation, using natural light, planting trees, hotels growing their own vegetables or supporting local farms, replacing plastic room keys with alternatives and supplying bamboo toothbrushes and combs.

According to the white paper, a 130-room five-star hotel uses up to one ton of plastic a year -- just in amenities.

In an industry where luxury often means importing and providing to guests -- whatever the cost -- Bensely believes his background as a gardener and the son of British organic farmers means he looks at projects differently. The designs for his human zoo attest to that.

"If I'm given a piece of land that is virgin, I look at it as though no matter what we do with it -- and I'm a pretty good architect -- we are going to make it worse. So it's all about mitigating damage... How do we build with minimal intervention on the land? <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Chiang Rai, Thailand (CNN) — Elephants don't sleep much. They eat loudly. They pass gas loudly, too.

The two transparent domes sit next to a large enclosure inhabited by three rescued elephants, which are cared for by the resort's Golden Triangle Asian Elephant Foundation

Guests can sit back and watch as these female elephants play with the strategically placed "toys" that hang from large trees, their powerful trunks occasionally ripping off huge chunks of bark and branches, sending loud cracks through the evening air.

But really, they mainly just want to eat.

Thankfully, a hefty supply of sugar cane is placed within eyesight of the bubbles, meaning the elephants are almost always just a few steps away.

Once-in-a-lifetime experience

l e v a r t

The bubbles are booked as an "experience" in addition to your reserved resort room, for 17,700 baht (US$563) per night per couple. This means you can just pack an overnight bag and leave the rest of your belongings in your suite.

Guests are picked up from the lobby just before sunset, then driven down a dirt road in an open-air jeep before taking a short walk through the resort's rice paddy to get to the bubbles.

Shortly after arrival, staff deliver an evening picnic basket, filled with pre-selected sandwiches and other cold dishes, allowing you to eat alongside the animals. There's a strict "no hands" policy when it comes to the elephants though -- bubble guests are not allowed to touch or feed them.

So how comfortable are the bubbles?

Each air-conditioned, pressurized 22-square-meter space is a mini slice of luxury, furnished with a comfortable king-sized bed. There's a small washroom with a toilet and shower, along with a couple of chairs and a small table near the bed. No TVs here -- the elephants are the star of this show.

Sensitive sleepers will find It particularly surreal. As night passed during a recent visit, the moon made its way over the bubble, offering various levels of illumination. (Eye masks are provided as it can be surprisingly bright.)

Given these ladies don't nod off much -- elephants in captivity sleep only 4-6 hours a day -- you'll hear all sorts of delightful sounds throughout the night and might find yourself crawling out of bed for a late-night peek.

The bed features wrap-around curtains, offering privacy for those who worry they won't wake up before the caretakers arrive with the elephants' breakfast.

Trial and error

The idea for the "Jungle Bubbles" came from General Manager Gaudéric Harang, who has been with the resort for about a year and a half. He says they were born of a desire to push the boundaries and offer a unique guest experience in line with modern luxury expectations.

In addition to safety concerns -- "making sure our bubbles would be elephant proof" -- he says they had to meet very high standards.

"As a top notch resort, we had to ensure the experience would be very luxurious and to the level of what is expected by our guests," he explains.

Once the bubbles were set up, Harang was the first to trial them.

"Being in the north of Thailand, we are lucky to have a climate that's more varied than in the rest of the country," he says. "Though short, we go through a winter season that is very cold. When the bubbles were finally ready [in December] it was 6 degrees Celsius in the morning and...well I froze!

"There was no heater. Also, being located in the jungle there is a lot of humidity so the bubbles were very wet at night due to all the condensation. So, I woke up at 3 a.m., soaked and cold."

As a result, the bubbles are now equipped with an air conditioner, space heater and dehumidifier to ensure a comfortable climate for all seasons.

"When I finally saw the bubbles in place I was so happy it all worked out, but I think I was only really impressed when I slept in it the second time [after the climate issues were sorted]," he recalls, telling CNN Travel it was truly a "wow" moment.

"When you finally live it, you see it's really a fantastic experience. We couldn't have planned it better."

The right elephants for the job

Picking the right elephants for the Jungle Bubbles experience was another logistical issue that needed to be sorted, says John Roberts, Anantara's Director of Elephants.

Besides size considerations -- how many elephants could comfortably live on the available plot of land? -- they also had to decide which of the camp's elephants would enjoy being together in the enclosure. Turns out, even elephants can get into tiffs with their friends -- just like humans but with an additional 3.5 tonnes of weight to throw around.

The three elephants in the Jungle Bubbles enclosure all arrived at the resort between 2006-2010, so Roberts and his team already had ample time to get familiar with their temperaments.

"We watched them for a long time," says Roberts. "We know that they like being together -- actually [two of them] are pretty much inseparable at this stage and if you try and separate them they get pretty stressed."

Offering a better life to captive elephants

Anantara's nonprofit Golden Triangle Asian Elephant Foundation (GTAEF), founded in 2006 and overseen by Roberts, cares for about two dozen elephants.

Most of the animals have led hard lives -- some spent their days walking the streets of Bangkok with their owners, making money begging from tourists. Others came from tourist trekking camps.

The way the program works is the foundation invites mahouts (elephant trainers/owners) and their families to move to Chiang Rai with their elephants and live in the foundation's camp.

The foundation offers them a wage, which includes the cost of care for their elephants. This amounts to about $18,000 per elephant per year.

Roberts acknowledges that in a perfect world all elephants would be roaming free in the wild but the situation is incredibly complex.

"Unfortunately, you can't release elephants in Thailand," he says, rattling off a long list of complications including fears of disease transmission, potential conflict in a fragile wild herd and an inability for domesticated elephants to fend for themselves given they've spent most if not all of their lives in captivity. And then there are Thailand's laws, which would also need to be changed.

Thailand's domesticated elephants are all registered under the Draft Animals Act, so "if you put a captive elephant in a national park you're officially illegally grazing your livestock and that's the law as it is," says Roberts.

As an alternative, the GTAEF aims to improve the welfare of captive elephants through various programs not just at its resort but throughout the region -- including mahout training -- while also taking part in conservation and wild elephant programs.

At the resort's elephant camp, this means figuring out the elephants' personalities though science and observation and matching them with activities that suit them -- an essential part of their well-being. For instance, elephants that are comfortable around strangers take part in the peaceful "Walking with Giants" experience.

"In the wild their entire lives are based around walking long distances and finding food," says Roberts. "They have big brains, you have to keep them stimulated doing different things. You could just put them out there in a field, but they'll stand in one spot all day."

The Anantara Golden Triangle Elephant Camp & Resort is located on the edge of Thailand's northern border in the town of Chiang Saen, just over an hour from Chiang Rai city.

There are two restaurants -- Thai eatery Sala Mae Nam and Baan Dhalia, which serves Italian -- while the poolside Elephant Bar and Opium Terrace is an essential stop for pre-dinner drinks.

The spacious rooms, featuring traditional Thai decor, come with long balconies that overlook both Laos and Myanmar. Coffee in hand, it's the perfect place to begin the day, watching the sun rise through the mist.

Resort activities include day trips to Laos and Myanmar, river boat journeys, spa treatments and in-house classes like cooking and Muay Thai.

(CNN) — Framed by abundant woodland, surrounded by icy water and bathed in the glowing winter sun, this new hotel in Swedish Lapland already sounds pretty special.

And that's before you realize its centerpiece is a circular structure adrift on the Lule River, reachable only via wooden walkway and designed to resemble a cluster of logs caught adrift on a Swedish waterway.

Welcome to Arctic Bath , a "floating hotel" in the Scandinavian north.

In the middle of this floating edifice is a giant ice bath, open to the elements and offering a pretty spectacular spa experience for guests who brave the cold. The rest of the building is comprised of various saunas and bathing experiences.

The hotel's 12 rooms are dotted around the river banks and on the water's edge, Scandi-chic cabins offering eye catching views of the ever-changing skies and cozy, minimalistic interiors.

This new accommodation spot, designed by architects Bertil Harström and Johan Kauppi, suggests a constant dialogue between nature and the man made structure.

Unusual design

Designs for Arctic Bath premiered back in early 2018 , with its striking architecture and watery theme capturing the imagination of travelers across the world.

CEO Peter Engström tells CNN Travel that taking the hotel from design to reality wasn't always easy -- in fact, he thinks if the team knew about the technical challenges in advance, it might have put them off altogether.

The decision to locate some of the rooms on land was decided fairly late in the process. While building on land is easier than on water, Engström said it provided its own challenges -- namely, to ensure the cabin's elevation didn't impact passage of fresh water and electricity.

The cabins were built above ground to avoid impact on the environment as sustainability is, Engström says, a "cornerstone" of the hotel's ethos.

Now Arctic Bath -- located about an hour and 15 minutes from Luleå Airport -- is open for business, and also offers first-rate culinary offerings at the hotel restaurant.

The theme of wellness is also pretty high on the list of priorities for Arctic Bath, the food's got a healthy bent, with locally sourced ingredients, while the emphasis on cold bathing is to aid muscle pain.

The ice bath, Engström says, in one of the hotel's main draws, even if guests might be daunted by the idea.

"Fifty percent of arriving guests say, 'I will never do that' -- but at least 90% really do the ice bath and more than once and they are all thrilled!"

Activities on offer include -- unsurprisingly, perhaps -- yoga, mindfulness and meditation.

There's also the opportunity to enjoy the great outdoors -- think bear watching, horseback riding and courses in wildlife photography.

During the winter months, the Northern Lights illuminate the skies above.

The Arctic Bath team is also keen to bridge the gap between tourists and locals living in the neaby village of Harads, and guests will have the opportunity to learn more about the local Sámi culture by visiting a local resident at her home.

"From the start we invited locals to stay with us," says Engström. They wanted the community to feel at home at Arctic Bath, and to offer feedback.

Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America, and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. He is the editor of the Coronavirus Daily Brief and author of the new book "Trump and His Generals: The Cost of Chaos." The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles at CNN.

(CNN) President Donald Trump and his team face a painful dilemma: If they take the draconian measures necessary to halt the coronavirus pandemic the economy will likely fall into not just a recession, but even a depression. On the other hand, if they take only half measures to halt the spread of the virus we could see the worst pandemic in American history.

The Trump administration has, by default, fallen into something of a middle ground between these two paths that is likely to lead both to a bad pandemic and a deep recession.

The costs of letting the disease spread uncontrollably were laid out in sobering detail in a study published last week by Imperial College , London. It found that as many as 2.2 million people could die of Covid-19 in the US if the disease were to spread completely uncontrolled. By way of comparison , 675,000 American died of the Spanish flu in 1918.

Of course, there are many mitigation measures in place now in the United States so the worst-case scenario of millions of deaths is quite unlikely to happen. Indeed, over 80 million Americans are now under orders to stay at home . And over 50 million more will be mandated to stay home in the coming days.

That means, however, that some 200 million other Americans still retain freedom of movement, which suggests that the highly contagious virus will very likely spread further.

And there lies the rub: If the Trump administration really closed the whole country down for many weeks to suppress the virus, the resulting depression could rival the Great Depression. Already, James Bullard, a top official of the Federal Reserve, estimates that second quarter unemployment could rise to 30% in the United States. The unemployment rate during the Great Depression peaked at around 25%

So far, Trump has said he is not considering implementing a national lockdown. And this may be the best call he can make given that he only has bad and worse choices in front of him.

Infectious disease expert Michael Osterholm of the University of Minnesota suggested in a Washington Post op-ed an approach that tries to balance halting the disease with the need not to completely destroy the economy and way of life: "letting those at low risk for serious disease continue to work, keep business and manufacturing operating, and 'run' society, while at the same time advising higher-risk individuals to protect themselves through physical distancing and ramping up our health-care capacity as aggressively as possible."

In a series of essays called The Distance, Thomas Lake is telling the stories of Americans living through the pandemic. This story is based on extensive phone interviews with the O'Donnell family. Email thomas.lake@cnn.com if you have a story to share.

(CNN) We begin in New York, a few months after the catastrophe. Not the virus of today, but the terrorist attack of 2001. A man walks into a bar near Ground Zero and sees a woman at the pool table, lining up a shot.

Down goes the 8-ball. She's running the table, holding off the Wall Street men. They slap down their quarters, waiting their turn, and she sinks them, one by one.

Patty is a classic New Yorker. Tough shell, soft heart. A woman who rescues injured birds. She's a waitress at Houlihan's in the Financial District, part of a small crew that came in to clean up and re-open the restaurant after the towers fell. Someone found part of a thumb on the rooftop. The air was filled with toxic dust.

Phil works 12 hours a day, seven days a week, fixing the lines for Verizon. He's dirty and exhausted, but he knows his way to the corner pocket.

He looks at Patty and lays down his quarters.

SCENE TWO

Mount Sinai Hospital, Valentine's Day 2017.

Patty and Phil have been married 13 years, but right now they're apart. She sleeps with one of his sweatshirts in the pull-out chair of their son's hospital room.

Aengus is 10. In recent weeks, Patty has watched him get sicker and sicker. It began with a sinus infection, which led to antibiotics, which apparently caused a rare and severe side effect. Aengus turned yellow.

Thomas Lake

Now he needs surgery to save his life. Patty, queen of the pool table, has been worn down by repeated trauma. She crashed her motorcycle. She was hit by a police car while crossing the street. And now this. She holds it together, waits for him to fall asleep. Then she goes in the bathroom and cries.

Elsewhere in the hospital, a surgeon cuts Phil open from navel to chest. He cuts Phil's liver in two, removing 60%. The liver is a strange and wonderful organ. It will regenerate. Phil will recover. Hospital workers rush part of his liver to its new recipient: a 10-year-old boy who needs a transplant. His son.

Henceforth in the O'Donnell household, February 14 is known as Surgery Day. The day Phil saved Aengus's life.

SCENE THREE

Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan, St. Patrick's Day 2020.

No parade, no green hair, no Irish soda bread. Life is canceled, but life goes on, except now you risk everything for a walk to the supermarket.

Aengus will go. Gristedes is across the street. A 15-minute errand. He takes Patty's credit card.

Patty has not left their basement apartment in five days. She was tested for coronavirus last Thursday and still doesn't know the result. Untold thousands of Americans are in the same predicament, or worse, with no test at all. She's been coughing, with an unusual headache and some difficulty breathing. All she can do is wonder and wait.

What would Covid-19 do to the O'Donnells? Their 15-year-old daughter would probably be fine, but the rest of them could be in trouble. Patty had asthma as a child, and she breathed the dust after 9/11. Phil did too, and about a year ago he developed a persistent cough. Then there is Aengus, now 13, taking immunosuppressant drugs to stop his body from rejecting his slice of Phil's liver.

Fifteen minutes. No big deal, except she's always afraid when he leaves her. Patty has depression, anxiety, nightmares, chronic injuries from the crashes. She's constantly trying to rescue something or someone, which is why they have so many pets. A dog, a cat, a hamster, two rabbits, and on and on. She found a woodpecker injured by a revolving door and delivered it for treatment at the Wild Bird Fund. Patty, savior of the wounded and broken, still figuring out how to save herself.

Things are uneasy between her and Phil, who is at work right now, splicing cables for Verizon. He thinks this whole virus thing is exaggerated. Truth is, he likes the quiet streets. Nobody honking. He says it's like an early Saturday morning in the middle of the afternoon.

Aengus walks outside, breathes the fresh air. His mother's words follow him. Don't touch your face. He likes Xbox and Japanese graphic novels. He does not mind that the eighth-grade prom was canceled, because it sounded boring.

In Gristedes, the shelves are more empty than usual. All the meat is gone. But they still have ice, and lemon lime seltzer, and strawberry Nesquik. He brings his purchases to the front and signs his mother's name.

Inside the apartment, Patty waits. The news on television seems to get worse and worse. She was late for work the morning of 9/11, and maybe it saved her life. She remembers a sandwich: cheese, lettuce, tomato, the usual order of one customer at Houlihan's, a vegetarian woman who never came back. Patty can still see the faces of the regular customers who just disappeared. Now she listens for the outer gate, the clanging lever that tells her someone is coming home.

"Call me," she used to tell Aengus and his sister every morning, back when school was still a thing. Sometimes the inside is scarier than the outside. She is prone to panic attacks, as are many of us these days.

We are still early in this crisis, still unsure of what and whom we will lose. Which person have you already seen for the last time? Call someone now and tell them you love them. Patty O'Donnell waits, and waits. Here is Aengus, with the groceries, opening the door. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

Her next book, upcoming for Penguin Press, is set in northeastern Syria. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Read more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) "I have no idea where my friends are," the teenage girl told me as we stood under the bright sun of a brisk winter morning. It was last December, and I was visiting Washokani camp , a displaced persons' camp housing Arab and Kurdish families who lost their homes to the Turkish offensive into northeastern Syria last year.

We spoke in front of the long white and blue tent that she and her sisters shared with their relatives -- one family now part of the more than 70 million displaced people worldwide. "I just want to be back in school," she said.

I think of this girl and so many others like her that I have had the privilege to meet -- and I fear what lies ahead for them, as coronavirus infects more and more people across the world. Whether refugees in a foreign land or internally displaced within their own, the millions of people fleeing home -- and living in camps like Washokani -- face a set of alarming realities: a catastrophe that could spread where access to soap fluctuates, access to water is a luxury and access to health care is limited -- at very best -- and non-existent at worst.

The world may think it can close borders and tune out the fate of these people, but that is no longer the case. What reaches one displaced person's camp will likely not remain there -- and the consequences for the host countries could be severe.

The international community therefore has a responsibility to put a plan into place. This includes, as advocated by Mona Yacoubian, the former deputy assistant administrator in the Middle East bureau of the US Agency for International Development, "dedicated funding for test kits for these populations accompanied by an action plan for their deployment."

In short, displaced people need quick, readily available and affordable coronavirus testing and functioning quarantining facilities in places where they now live. Additionally, what is needed is an awareness that women and girls must also be part of the solution to addressing -- and stopping -- the spread of the coronavirus.

"It really is a tinderbox waiting for the fire to rip through there," Hardin Lang, a veteran of UN peacekeeping operations, and now vice president for programs and policy at Refugees International, told me. "It is hard to imagine that this isn't going to be like Italy on steroids in a camp environment."

Or, as Jan Egeland, Secretary General of the Norwegian Refugee Council, which provides relief to the displaced around the world, puts it: "When the virus hits overcrowded settlements in places like Iran, Bangladesh, Afghanistan and Greece, the consequences will be devastating. We must act now."

These fears are felt with urgency by those on the front line of trying to help the displaced each day.

"There aren't any quarantine or isolation units in northwestern Syria," Amany Qaddour, regional director for Syria Relief and Development , an NGO her father and her sister founded in 2011, told me by WhatsApp from her home near the Syrian border. Syria Relief and Development has provided health-related services to several million people displaced in Idlib province in northwestern Syria, which the Syrian regime, backed by Russia, has sought to retake in recent months -- leading to one million people being displaced just since early December.

JUST WATCHED This child is smiling, but her story is devastating Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH This child is smiling, but her story is devastating 04:27

Many people now sleep in bombed-out buildings or in tents -- or simply out in the open, exposed to the elements. "We are waiting on kits to diagnose coronavirus and bleach and disinfectants -- there isn't enough bleach to procure in northwest Syria," says Qaddour.

The NGO is going into camps and facilities and making sure there is messaging around hygiene. But they are up against what nearly every camp setting faces: overcrowding and lousy sanitation -- and that's before there are any officially reported cases of coronavirus. There is also no clear timeline for when the World Health Organization will provide large supplies of disinfectants, such as bleach, though the WHO has assembled a task force to tackle these issues.

Still, according to the WHO, Syria is considered a "very high risk" country due to do the ongoing war, a fragile health care system and large numbers of displaced people. Dr. Nima Saaed Abid, a WHO representative, told CNN on Monday that she expects to see a "significant number of cases."

But tests aren't the only issue. Many displaced people don't have the ability to practice social distancing or shelter-in-place approaches to prevention. "We talk about the ability to stay home and be on lockdown, and we see people rushing to stores right now. That is not something you have in Syria -- you are not able to prepare for what appears to be an apocalypse and go get a month's worth of food," Qaddour says. "You're displaced, you are out in the open in a tent that might not even have a door and you cannot protect yourself from these threats... [including] the major threat of infectious disease."

For women and girls, the threat is even greater. Already Qaddour says of the situation in northwestern Syria -- and as I have seen in refugee and internal displaced settings in countries all around the world -- women and girls living in camps fear going to get water, going to shower or using the washroom because they risk harassment, or worse. Now they are being told they have to wash their hands throughout the day. This means they will be forced to risk their physical safety -- or risk their lives if nothing changes.

"It is almost a luxury to impose these sanitation requirements," Qaddour tells me, urging the creation of more hand washing stations in camps closer to where women and girls sleep, as well as additional protective measures -- such as possibly having security present in washing areas -- so that girls and women could safely access these spaces.

To those who say that the displaced don't matter at a time when borders are closing and coronavirus cases are spreading, medical facts say otherwise. Stopping coronavirus requires including the most vulnerable in the solution, and the most vulnerable includes those who have the least and have lost the most. The world's 70 million displaced stand first and foremost among them.

And even if the idea of shared humanity doesn't make you think this is urgent, self-interest must.

"Anywhere we have got large displaced populations, it is going to be impossible to segregate out their health from the health of the communities in which they are living," Lang says. "It is not only the right thing to do from a moral perspective to include them in the response, but it is also the smart thing to do."

(CNN) This past week has been the toughest of my career, as I'm sure is true for many of you. My city, New York, is under siege by this cruel and relentless virus. Most of my restaurants are now closed, other than the few mostly serving limited takeout and delivery. Millions of people in my industry are suddenly out of work, and no one knows when -- or whether -- relief will come.

Marcus Samuelsson

I am a chef by training, and certainly not a policy expert, but I can share insights from three unique vantage points: 1) as someone who works and lives in the economically disadvantaged neighborhood of Harlem; 2) as a small-business owner who employs and works alongside the residents of my community; and 3) as an émigré who grew up in Sweden, which taught me valuable lessons in how a government can and should care for its own.

Let's start with the first point. During this crisis, we need to be especially concerned about our nation's food-insecure population -- and think about nutrition the same way we think about health care. Food is as vital a resource as medicine. It's clear that this virus is going to have a devastating impact on urban communities like mine. We have to ensure we're not compounding that with the unnecessary deaths of our food-insecure neighbors.

We know the ranks of the food-insecure will grow exponentially in the weeks and months ahead. That's why we've partnered with organizations such as José Andres' World Central Kitchen to turn our restaurants into community kitchens.

Paul R. La Monica is a digital correspondent for CNN Business. He writes daily about the markets and blue chip companies and also appears regularly on CNNI's business programs. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

Boeing is going to need a bailout. Airlines will, too. And many other travel, tourism and service-related companies will also need some form of assistance from the federal government.

People need to accept that bailouts are a necessary evil in a time of unprecedented economic chaos caused by the coronavirus pandemic.

But we're already seeing signs that Democrats and Republicans are unable to cooperate for the good of the American people. The White House and Congressional leaders are still bickering over the final details on a mainstream economic stimulus package.

Yes, it's unfortunate that companies and CEOs that made bad, dumb and greedy decisions now need federal aid . But what's the alternative? Punish the rich at the expense of everyone else?

This argument came up in 2008, too. Some said we should let banks that took on too much risk tied to subprime mortgages fail.

New York (CNN Business) Several American industries that have been decimated by the coronavirus outbreak are asking for federal bailouts. The price tag reaches into the hundreds of billions of dollars.

The nation's restaurants need a massive $325 billion bailout, according to the industry's trade group. It is by far the largest request for help of any industry so far.

The hotel industry needs another $150 billion. The industry's request for help calls for $80 billion to $100 billion for income assistance for employees who are furloughed, and the rest in no-interest or low-interest loans for hotel owners. The industry has 8.3 million employees, according to its trade group.

And national retailers, the largest employer group in the nation, say they also need a variety of forms of government help, although it did not give an estimate for how much money would be involved.

While some retailers' sales have surged because of the crisis, others have had to shut operations as their regular customers avoid leaving their homes for anything but essentials.

The National Retail Federation said it is seeking changes to tax laws that would help retailers. It wants a mandatory pause on default and foreclosure actions for missed rent and mortgage payments. It also said they would need a government loan program, though it did not spell out details.

Aviation

These latest bailout pleas come on top of earlier requests from industries badly hit by the near-shutdown of much of the nation's normal economic activity.

The aviation industry is asking for $50 billion for passenger airlines and another $8 billion for cargo airlines, with half of that money coming in the form of grants and the other half loans.

The nation's airports have asked for $10 billion in help. The airport trade group suggested in a letter Wednesday that there could be defaults on $7 billion of debt payments this year without assistance, which would raise borrowing costs for future airport projects. Bond defaults could also rattle already unsettled financial markets.

Boeing BA On Tuesdayrequested $60 billion in loan guarantees for aerospace manufacturers , including itself and its suppliers. The trade group for the nation's public transit systems is seeking $12.9 billion.

Restaurants

In a letter to President Donald Trump, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, the National Restaurant Association says immediate help is needed to support restaurants and the 15.6 million workers who depend on them for jobs. It said without help many will not be able to reopen once the crisis has passed.

"We are revising our business model to provide meals in different ways (takeout, delivery, safety-enhanced dine-in), but we are facing economic headwinds that will lead many restaurants to shut down operations, lay off workers, and end our service in our communities," said the group's letter.

The core of the restaurant owners' request is $145 billion restaurant and food service industry recovery fund, to give restaurants grants to allow them to pay employees, maintain service operations and meet financial and contract obligations.

The group is also asking for $100 billion in federally-backed business interruption insurance, since many private policies are not covering shutdowns from pandemics, as well as $35 billion for community block grants that typically go to businesses in areas hit by natural disasters and $45 billion in federal loans.

They are also seeking a federal loan program to match lost revenue during the next three months. The group estimates that could be as much as $225 billion in lost revenues.

Restaurants are a particularly low-margin business with a high rate of failure, even during the good times. With many local governments ordering restaurants and bars to close and curfews to be imposed, massive failures could cost jobs even after virus outbreak is under control.

How these compare to past bailouts

If approved, the restaurant bailout could be the biggest in government history, although the amount of help the retailers might receive could top this amount.

Mortgage lenders Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac received $187.5 billion in federal help following the 2008 financial crisis.

Insurer AIG received $182 billion. The nation's banks received $250.5 billion. But taxpayers eventually made back all of that money through dividends or sales of stock in those institutions that the government received as part of those bailouts. Relatively little of the bailouts at that time went to direct grants, as the restaurant owners are now requesting.

The government did lose about $12 billion on the the nearly $80 billion it used to bail out the auto industry, as well as the $15 billion bailout of the nation's airlines following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. But that cost would be a fraction of the grants that just the restaurant owners are asking for this time. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Rick Santorum is a CNN senior political commentator and a former Republican senator from Pennsylvania. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) We are all coming to terms with the economic consequences of the extraordinary circumstances we find ourselves in because of the coronavirus. Who could have foreseen that self-distancing would turn into being self-quarantined with businesses all over the country shutting down? The situation became even more dire with some governors and mayors closing all "non-essential" businesses. Californians and New Yorkers are even being ordered to stay home.

First, we should ask ourselves, "What have I done today to help someone who has been adversely affected by the coronavirus outbreak?" We can show the world what is special about our country. French historian and political scientist Alexis de Tocqueville observed the charitable spirit so characteristic of Americans. We solve problems at the local level and help our neighbors. Now we have the opportunity to display that spirit more than ever!

Second, we can encourage government to take wise action to support working Americans. I opposed government bailouts in the past because they focused on Wall Street, particularly mismanaged business. This emergency is quite different. The average family could have never anticipated that all of their income -- and any other job opportunity -- would stop at the same time.

Congress is currently negotiating a new stimulus package and has the opportunity to provide real support to working families that will also uphold the economy until this emergency passes. If done correctly, this will keep businesses and non-profits on hold and prepared to reopen -- with their employees ready to go back to work -- once Covid-19 is behind us.

Senators Marco Rubio, Susan Collins, and Lamar Alexander have introduced the Keeping Workers Paid and Employed Act that should be included in the new stimulus. It would provide employers who maintain their payroll during this crisis 100% federally guaranteed loans. The loans would be forgiven if used to provide payroll to their employees. Loans are also available for other needs like supply chain disruptions, mortgage payments and other debt obligations.

Last week, President Donald Trump signed into law a coronavirus relief package that provides up to two weeks of sick leave to those with coronavirus, seeking diagnoses, advised to stay home due to symptoms or exposure or caring for someone quarantined by the virus (though businesses with over 500 employees were not mentioned in this bill). It also provided 12 weeks of paid leave only to those caring for children because their school or daycare was closed.

Congress needs to do better to expand this leave to cover large businesses with over 500 employees and to expand the paid leave provisions to cover those caring for family members, elderly or the disabled who have no other options.

We know large businesses are good at advocating for their interests but let's make sure they do the right thing for their workers by providing sick and paid leave if they do receive any stimulus funds. It is important that members of Congress consider the average worker, small businesses and nonprofits as they finalize this emergency stimulus legislation.

While this government action is expensive, it is still a better option than having to rebuild the entire economy from scratch with economically devastated employees and no market for products. It is crucial that we keep businesses solvent and workers prepared to go back to work. If we don't act quickly, the financial cost will be even greater and the human cost incalculable. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
The California State Public Health Officer and Director of the California Department of Public Health is ordering all individuals living in the State of California to stay home or at their place of residence, except as needed to maintain continuity of operation of the federal critical infrastructure sectors.

Yes. The State Public Health Officer may issue orders as needed – for example if more information emerges about the public health situation – and issue new orders and directives as conditions warrant.

How does this order interact with local orders to shelter in place? Does it supersede them?

This is a statewide order.

Business and taxes

What businesses and organizations are exempt?

Businesses and organizations that provide critical infrastructure for the state are exempted, including health care and public health, public safety, food and agriculture and media. See the full list of exempt sectors (pdf).

I run/work at an exempted business or organization, as defined by the Order. Do I need to get an official letter of authorization from the state to operate?

No. If your business or organization is in the list of exempt sectors, it may still operate. You do not need to obtain any specific authorization from the state to do so.

Do I need to pay my taxes?

Yes, state and federal deadlines have been extended. All state taxes are now due on July 15.

Schools and childcare

My school is providing free grab-and-go meals and childcare. Are those still open?

Yes. It is essential to keep children fed and educated. School employees should report to work and focus on distance learning, school meals, and childcare/supervision.

Are daycares still open? Can my babysitter still come to the house?

Yes. Daycares are still open, but only for children of parents working in essential sectors. Daycare centers that remain open should employ heightened cleaning and distancing requirements. Babysitters may also come to the house to care for minors of parents working in essential sectors.

Health care and helping sick relatives

What if I need to visit a health care provider?

If you are feeling sick with flu-like symptoms, please first call your doctor, a nurse hotline, or an urgent care center.

If you need to go to the hospital, call ahead so they can prepare for your arrival. If you need to call 911, tell the 911 operator the exact symptoms you are experiencing so the ambulance provider can prepare to treat you safely.

What about routine, elective or non-urgent medical appointments?

Non-essential medical care like eye exams, teeth cleaning, and elective procedures must/should be cancelled or rescheduled. If possible, health care visits should be done remotely.

Contact your health care provider to see what services they are providing.

May I still go out to get my prescriptions?

Yes. You may leave their homes to obtain prescriptions or get cannabis from a licensed cannabis retailer.

Can I leave home to care for my elderly parents or friends who require assistance to care for themselves? Or a friend or family member who has disabilities?

Yes. Be sure that you protect them and yourself by following social distancing guidelines such as washing hands before and after, using hand sanitizer, maintaining at least six feet of distance when possible, and coughing or sneezing into your elbow or a tissue and then washing your hands. If you have early signs of a cold, please stay away from your older loved ones.

Can I visit loved ones in the hospital, nursing home, skilled nursing facility, or other residential care facility?

Generally no. There are limited exceptions, such as if you are going to the hospital with a minor who is under 18 or someone who is developmentally disabled and needs assistance. For most other situations, the order prohibits non-necessary visitation to these kinds of facilities except at the end-of-life. This is difficult, but necessary to protect hospital staff and other patients.

Outdoor recreation

Can I still exercise? Take my kids to the park for fresh air? Take a walk around the block? Walk my dog?

Yes. So long as you are maintaining a safe social distance of six feet from people who aren’t part of your household, it is ok to go outside for exercise, a walk or fresh air. Gyms are closed.

Can people still go hiking or visit State Parks?

Californians can walk, run, hike and bike in their local neighborhoods as long as they continue to practice social distancing of 6 feet. This means avoiding crowded trails & parking lots. To help reduce crowds, State Parks is modifying operations at some parks, including closing vehicular access and parking lots to reduce density of visitors. A list of closures can be found at www.parks.ca.gov/flattenthecurve. Everyone has the responsibility to “Flatten the COVID-19 Curve at Parks” by maintaining a social distance of 6 feet or more when recreating in the outdoors, and staying home if they are sick. If visitors cannot maintain social distancing, they need to leave the park.

For information on National Parks, please visit their website here.

Pets

Can I walk my dog? Take my pet to the vet?

You can walk your dog. You can go to the vet or pet hospital if your pet is sick. Remember to distance yourself at least six feet from other pets and owners. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Friday ordered nonessential businesses to keep 100% of their workforce at home, and he put in place stringent new restrictions on New Yorkers starting Sunday as the state grapples with the worst coronavirus outbreak in the U.S.

"When I talk about the most drastic action we can take, this is the most drastic action we can take," Cuomo said at a press conference in Albany. Cases across the state surged by 2,950 overnight to 7,102, he said. "This is not life as usual. Accept it. Realize it and deal with it."

Cuomo acknowledged that the restrictions will force businesses to close and people to lose their jobs, adding that he's suspending evictions across the state for 90 days.

"We're all in quarantine now. We're all in various levels of quarantine and it's hard," he said.

New York Mayor Bill de Blasio has been pushing Cuomo to issue a shelter-in-place order for New York City, where cases skyrocketed by more than 1,000 in a matter of hours on Thursday. More than half of the state's cases are concentrated within the five boroughs. De Blasio, later Friday, said the city has become the new epicenter for the outbreak in the nation with 5,151 confirmed infections, about a third of all U.S. cases.

New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy announced later Friday that he also plans to shut down nonessential businesses, adding that he expects to issue an executive order on Saturday. "If you are not need as part of our response efforts, stay home and practice social distancing," he said.

Illinois Gov. Jay Pritzker also announced later Friday a statewide "stay-at-home" order. The measure takes effect on Saturday at 5 p.m. and will last until April 7, he said, adding that people will still be able to leave their homes to buy groceries, go running and for other purposes.

"To avoid the loss of potentially tens of thousands of lives, we must enact an immediate stay-at-home order for the state of Illinois," he said at a news briefing. "For the vast majority of you already taking precautions, your lives will not change very much."

Cuomo didn't call the new restrictions a "shelter-in-place" order, although many of them mirror what's in place elsewhere in the country where officials have put such an order in place.

"It is not a shelter-in-place order," Cuomo said, adding that he doesn't want to scare residents. "Shelter in place is used currently for an active shooter or a school shooter."

When in public, individuals must practice social distancing of at least 6 feet, he said. Businesses that provide essential services, like grocery stores, pharmacies, banks and food delivery, must implement rules that ensure employees and customers maintain at least 6 feet of space between each other, according to a slide presented at the press conference. Individuals should also limit use of public transit only if it's absolutely necessary. Individuals will also need to limit outdoor activities, avoiding ones where they come into close contact with other people. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Ryan Nunn is policy director for The Hamilton Project and fellow in Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

Just a few weeks ago, the unemployment rate was at an historic low and the US labor market was the strongest it had been in many years. As we find ourselves preparing for the increased likelihood that millions of Americans are about to lose their jobs in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic, what can be done to mitigate the suffering this crisis is beginning to inflict?

We know from past experience that economic downturns are accompanied by substantial increases in unemployment, as workers are laid off and employers reduce their hiring. This recession will almost certainly feature an especially rapid increase in unemployment, relative to previous recessions. One of the extraordinary — but necessary — realities of the coronavirus crisis is that policymakers are deliberately shutting down economic activity in order to reduce further spread of the virus. We may very well see an unprecedently large and fast surge of unemployment claims in coming days and weeks.

It is therefore urgently necessary that we provide financial support to those hurt by the coming recession, and unemployment insurance is one of the best ways of doing so in a targeted way. One of the first lines of defense in any recession is the unemployment insurance (UI) system. The UI system has stabilized the lives of many workers and their families in previous recessions, but it has serious weaknesses that we must remedy now.

To make UI more effective in the current crisis, policymakers at the state and federal levels should immediately take the following steps.

Eliminate job search requirements

Anthony Scaramucci is founder and managing partner of SkyBridge Capital, a global alternative investments firm, and served as White House communications director. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

The United States government needs to start thinking bigger about fiscal stimulus to combat the economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, or else it risks another Great Depression.

The world is at war with an invisible enemy, and we need a wartime-like public health and economic response if we hope to prevail. The Federal Reserve has done all it can by moving interest rates back to zero and announcing open-ended quantitative easing , but, as we've seen in Europe and Japan, all the liquidity in the world doesn't mean a thing if aggregate demand dries up. Goldman Sachs now projects Q2 GDP to fall as much as 24%.

The Treasury Department last week unveiled a $1 trillion stimulus proposal that includes small business loans and targeted industry bailouts. That is not nearly enough, nor is it the right approach.

Based on deficit levels the US government took on during World War II, we believe we have room to enact $3.2 trillion in fiscal stimulus — more than triple the current Treasury proposal.

I would take three key steps as part of a historic $3.2 trillion stimulus to combat economic fallout from the coronavirus pandemic:

Send people money

The federal government should, as soon as possible, send $3,000 to every adult and $1,500 to every child to cover basic living expenses for the next three months. The estimated total cost would be around $900 billion.

Backstop jobs

The federal government should become the "buyer of last resort" for all industries suffering as a result of unprecedented social distancing guidelines, a solution mooted by economists Emmanuel Saez and Gabriel Zucman

The government would fill in revenue shortfalls across all industries, rather than conduct selective bailouts, with the requirement that companies receiving aid agree not to lay off any workers and to suspend dividends for three years and share buybacks indefinitely. For contract workers, the program would act like unemployment insurance. Universal paid sick leave would be guaranteed by the federal government. Interest-free credit lines would be made available to address short-term liquidity issues.

This is the most straightforward way to avoid mass job losses, prevent huge holes from forming in state fiscal budgets and allow companies to quickly resume the normal course of business when the virus abates.

Cut taxes

The Treasury has already pushed back Tax Day until July 15, but it should take a step further and eliminate federal income taxes this year for the bottom 75% of the population, or households making less than $85,000. The government should also suspend all mortgage, rent, student loan and tax payments for up to 90 days.

These economic measures should be taken in concert with an expanded federal public health response, including a 30-day nationwide shutdown to flatten the curve of infection, free drive-thru coronavirus testing centers, temporary hospital facilities and the federal purchase or manufacture of respirators and ventilators for all those who need them.

The coronavirus pandemic has laid bare the fragility and stratification of both our American health care and socioeconomic systems. Nearly 75% of Americans live paycheck-to-paycheck without emergency savings or the means to cover costs from an unexpected health issue. For the wealthiest country in the world, that is unacceptable. When the current crisis subsides, we need to address these issues with a more progressive and efficient tax code, smarter social safety nets that confront modern realities and expanded health care coverage for low-income Americans.

The economic recovery from the global financial crisis was slow by historical standards due to the fact we undershot the size of fiscal stimulus in 2009. Let's not make the same mistake again. With the right solutions, we can come through this crisis stronger and more united than we entered it. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Nawaf Obaid, a former Saudi Arabian government advisor from 2002 to 2015, is the author of The Failure of the Muslim Brotherhood in the Arab World, and was a Harvard fellow from 2012 to 2018. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

When Saudi Arabia, OPEC's de facto leader and most influential member, decided at its latest meeting in Vienna to break its recent strategic oil partnership with Russia and adopt a new policy to maximize production levels, oil prices crashed — posting their biggest slide since the Gulf war in 1991.

But even more importantly, this new policy recalibrated global oil markets, giving Saudi Arabia the long-term advantage. This move marks a big change for the world's largest oil exporter, which has in recent years attempted to manage the global oil markets by altering production levels, while garnering the difficult cooperation of Russia. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman has finally decided to pursue a long-term policy that not only preserves and ultimately increases the kingdom's market share, but also may signal the end of OPEC as a united functioning organization.

This decision is very unpopular with most oil exporting countries, international energy companies and American shale producers because collapsing prices will drastically decrease their revenues and, in some cases, force them into bankruptcy.

There are several reasons why the kingdom is finally taking this aggressive approach.

First, the successive Saudi monarchs have all recognized the strategic importance of spare production capacity to manage the global markets because it provides the vital indicator of the world's oil market's ability to respond to sudden crises that jeopardize the free flow of oil supplies.

Fox News personality Jesse Watters asked China for a formal apology earlier this month during "The Five," a Fox News panel talk show he co-hosts. According to Watters, the virus originated from Chinese people eating raw bats and snakes because "the Chinese communist government cannot feed the people, and they are desperate."

Watters also said scientists believe this to be the origin of the virus, despite no credible disease expert having made any statement of the sort. Scientists do believe the virus likely originated in an animal before transmission to a human host, but the exact sequence of events or even the animal in question remains unknown.

Watters has not responded to the global backlash against his comments, though he did say recently on his show, as infections in the US continue to spiral, that he has started to take social distancing more seriously.

In a seemingly retaliatory move , a Chinese government spokesman took to Twitter to suggest an unfounded claim that it may have been the "US army [that] brought the epidemic to Wuhan" instead. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman, Zhao Lijian, republished a one-minute clip of Robert Redfield, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, at a US congressional hearing on the virus. In the clip, Redfield can be heard admitting to cases of deaths in the US from the coronavirus that were previously misattributed to influenza.

Despite this having nothing to do with the US army and their visit to Wuhan for the Military World Games in October 2019, Zhao is seemingly using the evidence of misdiagnosis and a lack of transparency as ammunition to fire back at the US.

As the whole world now scrambles to deal with an escalating threat that just a month ago seemed to be a "Chinese problem," it is time to acknowledge that blame is hardly the point and most definitely not the solution.

In fact, the deep-seated Sinophobia, or anti-Chinese bias, underlying the initial urge to judge China for the problem is what has allowed Covid-19 to catch the US off guard with its widely criticized response to the pandemic.

As China has grown economically and politically to a position of global influence since the late 1990s, it has received backlash and criticism, particularly from its neighbors in Asia Pacific and in Western Europe and the United States. Many questions that have been raised regarding human rights violations are valid, but some, including Watters' comments that intend to paint China as an underdeveloped, backwards country, are more self-serving than anything else.

By vilifying China, critics like Watters perpetuate a narrative of Western supremacy. This narrative is so pervasive that despite reports that China is now home to more of the world's wealthiest people than the US, some people still believe that everyone in China lives in extreme poverty.

The misconception of what it means to be Chinese or live in China has cultivated a widespread negative sentiment towards the Chinese people, leading to a rise in hate crimes against people of Chinese or Asian descent. Such negative sentiment informs not only how we treat Chinese or Asians in general whom we encounter but also how quickly we are to accept any criticism of the Chinese government or Chinese officials without much substantiation.

Without dwelling too much on substantiating what should be a well-known fact, it is easy to point to universities like Tsinghua, the wide adoption of mobile payment and apps, and the massive footprint of luxury brands in China to debunk all the aforementioned depictions of the Asian country and its people.

The virus was thus not born in a setting of extreme poverty and filth but rather somewhere much more like home. Hence, Covid-19 is now trending worldwide.

Trump's choice of words is intended to "other" the virus, a strategy that he has used in the past to characterize other threats to America and the American way of life. The President claims that his choice of words is "not racist at all." With so many cases in the US, Trump's central focus on the origin of the virus cannot be more irrelevant now.

Similarly, many foreigners, even some of the expats I work with in Hong Kong who have visited China, cling to the misconception that Chinese people must be the source of the spread of the virus anywhere.

For instance, in Italy, which is now on lockdown as it struggles to contain, at the time of writing, nearly 55,000 cases of the coronavirus, the Tuscan city of Prato is home to the highest concentration of Chinese migrants in the country. On more than one occasion, people I have engaged in casual conversations with about the coronavirus have tried to point to the town as the source of the virus in Italy.

However, by early March, two weeks into Italy's initial lockdown of the original "red zones" -- so named for their high level of infections -- there were no reported cases of the coronavirus in Prato , the city or the larger province of which it is the capital.

In Hong Kong, there have been widespread calls for Chief Executive Carrie Lam to shut all border crossings with China since January. Lam has refused.

It should be clear that many of those who blame China at this late stage for the spread of Covid-19 are likely seeking to shift blame from their own inadequate responses. Regardless of where the virus originated, cases have been reported on every continent except for Antarctica. Due to its incubation period, which may be as long as 14 days, everyone we see, including healthy-looking, non-Chinese people, could be a carrier.

As the global fight against an unprecedented virus drags on, we should be open-minded and accept that good disease-combating measures can come from anywhere, including China. It truly would be a shame if more people had to die because of some age-old prejudice. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) When Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau announced on Monday that the Canadian border would be closed to foreigners, reporters pelted him with questions on why Americans were exempt when experts said that the US could be on its way to mirroring the global coronavirus epicenter of Italy because they both had a delayed response to the virus.

However, on Wednesday, at a time when major coronavirus mitigation decisions are being made with mind-numbing speed by governments worldwide, US President Donald Trump tweeted that "we will be, by mutual consent, temporarily closing our Northern Border with Canada to non-essential traffic. Trade will not be affected."

The unprecedented closure, even though it allows wide exemptions for groups like seasonal workers, is the most far-reaching travel restriction in terms of geography covered -- 8,891 kilometers (5,525 miles) -- put into place in North America since the outbreak reached our common shores.

The closure is jarring to our national psyche as Canadians: Many of us up north regard the ability to cross the world's longest undefended border right up there in importance with lacing up a pair of ice skates in the dead of the Canadian winter.

But the sacrifice will be welcomed by most Canadians: the temporary closure will be seen as an added layer of protection from a neighbor which has bungled its response to the coronavirus outbreak with a shocking lack of preparedness, by, for example, delaying action to better supply hospitals for a massive surge in patients.

At the time of writing, the US has more than 10,900 cases -- with more than 160 deaths -- across all 50 states.

Some polls suggest Canadian and Americans, especially Democrats, share a similar degree of concern about the coronavirus outbreak. A recent poll by the nonprofit Angus Reid Institute shows that a solid majority of Canadians (68%) "view the threat of the coronavirus as serious." A poll from NBC News and the Wall Street Journal indicated that 53% of US registered voters and 68% of Democrats worry that a family member might catch the virus.

British Columbia -- which had 231 coronavirus cases as of Wednesday and sits adjacent to one of the key US epicenters of the virus outbreak, Washington state -- has been pushing for the US border closure. The World Health Organization (WHO) and Canada's chief public health officer, Dr. Theresa Tam, discouraged trade and travel restrictions, saying they have limited impact in terms of preventing the virus spread.

"Countries that enacted travel bans for example have not been able to keep out this particular virus," said Tam.

The border measures are mainly aimed at curtailing the movement of cross-border shoppers and tourists. Travelers conducting "essential work" and the nearly US $2 billion in goods and services that cross the border each day will be unaffected.

Trudeau said he and Trump have told their citizens to stay put at home. "We are telling our citizens not to visit their neighbors if they don't absolutely have to. This collaborative and reciprocal measure is an extension of that prudent approach."

Ottawa-based political analyst Yaroslav Baran told me the decision to restrict border crossings was based on "advice from experts from both sides. Limit people movement while keeping supply chains open."

Our geographical integration is so complete that in some parts of the country, such as Port Roberts, just south of Vancouver, it is easy to drive into US territory by mistake.

Where I live in southern British Columbia, border crossing wait times are broadcast on local radio at the tail end of the weather forecast. Long summer days in my sleepy seaside village of Sidney, which has a spectacular view of snow-covered Mount Baker, are punctuated by the twice-daily arrival of the majestic Washington state ferries with names like MV Elwha and MV Chelan

In southern Ontario border cities such as Windsor and Niagara Falls, residents cross the border with the same ease most folks head to the local mall.

Americans, too, could feel the pain by the closures: a growing number cross the border in order to purchase prescriptions drugs, such as insulin, at a fraction of the cost found in the United States. The practice falls into a legal gray zone and as of Wednesday it was not clear whether trips to purchase cheaper essential drugs would be allowed.

Officials in Ottawa and Washington gave assurances the border restrictions are temporary. But if the virus numbers continue to trend upward the way they have over the past days, expect Ottawa -- which has been saying "nothing is off the table" to protect Canadians -- to demand a near-complete closure to human traffic.

An invisible, terrifying virus which has no respect for boundaries is throwing up barriers to human contact unlike anything we have seen previously. Let us hope our historic ties are robust enough to preserve an enviable bilateral relationship that seems endangered in an increasingly divided world. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Kate Williams is Professor of History at Reading University, a CNN royal historian/commentator and author of "Young Elizabeth," about the Queen. The views expressed here are her own.

(CNN) Divorce has always been a complicated issue, to say the least, for the royal family -- right back to King Henry VIII's reign during the 16th century, when he changed the course of world religion to get out of one marriage and into another.

But in more recent history, as divorce has become more common in Britain and across the world, the royal family has shown that in this way, at least, they really are just like the rest of us.

Our future King and his consort are both divorced, and there's no constitutional crisis to be found. Prince Harry married divorcee Meghan Markle in St. George's Chapel and the world was delighted by their nuptials and mutual devotion royal divorces were announced back-to-back this year, and they received about the same amount of flash-in-the-pan interest as a Hollywood breakup.

This shift in acceptance has happened only in the past three decades, after three Windsor divorces rocked the royal family in the 1990s -- and it was never the same again.

In the past, marital breakups spelled disaster for the reigning House of Windsor. Queen Elizabeth II's uncle, Edward VIII, gave up the throne for the twice-divorced Wallis Simpson in 1936, causing a political crisis that was narrowly averted. At the time, divorcees were not acceptable in society, and the royal Court was the strictest of all.

It's a hurdle prior English and British monarchs knew well. Henry VIII had the entire kingdom break from the Church of Rome in 1533 so he could split from Catherine of Aragon and marry Anne Boleyn in his quest for a male heir -- a history-defining moment set in motion because the Catholic Church wouldn't grant his request for an annulment.

In the early 19th century, profligate George IV tried to divorce his wife by accusing her of adultery, and the public was shocked by his exposure of her.

Queen Victoria's son, the future Edward VII, seduced various women, mostly married. He expected the husbands to put up with it. One did not, and he threatened to divorce his wife, Harriet Mordaunt -- and the prospect of the Prince of Wales as a witness in a divorce case was too dreadful. A coverup was launched, and Harriet was declared mad and packed off to an asylum for the rest of her life.

By the early 20th century, divorce law was changing. In 1923, as part of a raft of pro-women reforms instigated after World War I, the Matrimonial Causes Act allowed women as well as men to petition for divorce solely on the grounds of adultery.

Yet divorce was still frowned on in British society -- and marrying a divorcee whose former spouse was still alive was verboten according to the Church of England. This is why Edward VIII had to abdicate the throne for his brother George VI: He couldn't be both the head of his country's Church -- a role established, ironically, by his divorced ancestor Henry VIII -- and the husband of a divorced woman with two living spouses.

Even Queen Elizabeth II previously upheld these strict rules. In the early years of her marriage to Prince Philip, a then-Princess Elizabeth gave a speech to a Christian women's organization called the Mothers' Union declaring "divorce and separation are responsible for some of the darkest evils in our society today." But only a few years later, it became clear that her sister, Margaret, was in a relationship with their father's former courtier, Peter Townsend, a man not only 16 years her senior but also one who'd just filed for divorce six months earlier.

Margaret adored Townsend, but his divorced status was a problem -- it was that old Church rule about not marrying divorcees again. Although measures were drawn up by which she would be allowed to keep her title and continue performing public duties, she would lose her place in the succession. The Princess finally decided not to marry -- choosing duty, unlike her uncle Edward, over love.

Since then, giant weddings were perhaps something of a curse. The 1980s saw over-the-top weddings for Prince Charles and Diana, which was watched by nearly a billion people across the world, and Prince Andrew and Sarah at Westminster Abbey. In 1992, the year the Queen has called her 'annus horribilis,' those fairy-tale images were torn to pieces.

Prince Andrew announced he was separating from his wife, and Princess Anne, the Queen's only daughter, finalized her own divorce after separating from Mark Phillips three years prior . Then in June, Andrew Morton's bombshell book "Diana, her True Story" was published, sharing with the world the story of a woman so unhappy in an unloving relationship that she had considered suicide.

Tabloid leaks and speculation dogged Charles and Diana until the end of 1992, when the Prime Minister announced the separation of the Prince and Princess of Wales. The speculation continued and, in 1995, Diana gave an interview to the BBC in which she talked about her unhappiness at her husband's affair. "There were three of us in this marriage," she famously said -- and subsequently, the Queen actually encouraged Charles and Diana to officially divorce, which they did in 1996.

It would take another six years before the Church of England agreed to allow divorced people with a spouse still living to remarry in their houses of worship, and in 2005, Charles married Camilla Parker-Bowles, who herself had divorced in 1994.

All of this set the stage for the Windsors to come full circle in their public acceptance of divorce, from it being anathema to being increasingly common. The queen sends out congratulatory telegrams to her subjects when they have been married for 60 years, but her own children are unlikely to reach the milestone. And in this way, the monarchy is a reflection of its people: British society itself has become more accepting about marital splits, with just over 40% of couples ending their unions as of 2016.

As we've seen throughout history, royals and their spouses locking themselves into toxic relationships or marriages that were clearly prisons in an effort to uphold ancient rules hasn't worked out so well -- for them, or their populace. The painful dramas around the divorces have at times undermined their popularity, and what should have been private pain was publicly displayed. The royal family may have been dragged into accepting divorce and the idea of marrying divorcees, but it is vital that they did. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Kent Sepkowitz, MD, is an infection control expert at Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York City. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) As the COVID-19 pandemic continues to worsen, much attention in the US has been given to improving the availability of the diagnostic test.

Though testing is known to effectively reduce the risk of transmission, many experts are beginning to also associate more widespread testing with the statistic of greatest concern -- survival from the disease.

The connection seems straightforward. Consider two countries with large outbreaks.

In South Korea, the rate of testing has been quite high (3,692 tests per million people as of March 8), and its mortality among those infected quite low (about 0.6%, or 66 deaths, at last count).

By contrast, Italy tests about 826 people per million and its mortality among those with diagnosed infection is about 10 times higher, with more than 1,000 people dead from the disease.

Furthermore, stories abound of sick people in the US showing up at doctors' offices and hospital ERs, asking to be tested yet being sent away because no test is available or because they don't fit the testing criteria -- leading many to comment that the lack of testing is going to kill us all.

But we should be clear that more testing saves lives by preventing the next infection, not by allowing doctors to catch an individual patient earlier. The "treat early" paradigm works when there is an effective drug against the disease. Give antibiotics early for sepsis, you live; wait too long, you die.

The coronavirus, though, has no specific treatment. Indeed, the syndrome of a rapidly progressing lung failure that appears to kill COVID-infected persons is a familiar clinical condition. Many infections and exposures can cause the same problem; ICU specialists have been treating it for years.

So why does Korea, the poster child of testing, have so few deaths while Italy and its late-to-the-table testing program have so many? Is it only because more testing brings mild cases into the "infected" group, diluting the statistical impact of the handful of the very ill?

Doubtful. For now, it is because of vast differences in the affected patients. Soon and increasingly, it also will be due to overwhelmed hospitals and doctors and nurses.

Which is probably bad news for those hoping that the United States, which is currently way, way behind in testing for coronavirus, can somehow test itself out of the mess.

Plenty has already been written about how the population of Italy differs from much of the world. According to a UN report in 2015, 28.6% of the Italian population was 60 years old or older (second in the world after Japan at 33%). This compares to South Korea, where 18.5% of the population is at least 60 years of age, ranking 53rd globally.

The impact of this disparity is quickly shown in the analysis of coronavirus deaths in each county. In Italy, 90% of the more than 1,000 deaths occur in those 70 or older.

By contrast, the outbreak in South Korea has occurred among much younger people . There, only 20% of cases have been diagnosed in those 60 years old and up. The largest affected group is those in their 20s, who account for almost 30% of all cases.

Then there is gender. The gender split in COVID-19 cases worldwide is about 50-50, but there are gender differences in survival. According to data from the original outbreak in China, the overall death rate is 4.7% in men versus 2.8% in women -- a whopping difference. Which is good news for South Korea, where 62% of cases occur among women.

Smoking is another factor clearly associated with poor survival. Smoking rates are about the same between the two countries: 24% for Italians and 27% for South Koreans. But gender differences among smokers are widely different: In Italy, 28% of men versus 20% of women smoke, while in Korea, it is about 50% of men and less than 5% (!) of women.

In other words, South Korea has an outbreak among youngish, non-smoking women, whereas Italy's disease is occurring among the old and the very old, many of whom are smokers. (We do not know the male-female breakdown of Italy's cases).

These basic demographic distinctions explain the difference in death rates between these two hard-hit countries -- as well as helping to explain why Seattle, with its nursing home outbreak, accounts for such a large proportion of US coronavirus deaths.

To understand exactly what is happening, we need daily case updates to include information about age and sex.

The blundering lack of an effective testing program in the US is an unconscionable failure and has led (and will lead) to more transmission of COVID-19.

But it is important to recognize that survival with the infection is a completely other matter, one that will require very different investments, training, and expertise.

The optimal program will have special beds to prevent bed sores, pharmacists with understanding of how medications are cleared differently in the elderly, and nurses familiar with frailty. Simply testing more and testing harder will not save the lives of the thousands of already infected Americans.

Better preparation might. And given the glaring differences in the outbreaks in South Korea and Italy, it is time to assemble an expert panel of geriatricians, social scientists, ICU specialists and others to sort out how best to protect and, when necessary, treat coronavirus in the elderly. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) Well, I'm back. My month working in Paris came to a slightly premature end shortly after 2 a.m. Thursday (9 p.m. Wednesday in New York). I had heard President Donald Trump on CNN International, announcing that all folks coming from Europe would be barred entry into the US beginning midnight Friday, and quickly began to re-think my plans.

The French are hard to shake from their normally phlegmatic approach to sundry crises. Bertheil, the men's clothing shop on the ground floor of my apartment building around the corner from the Musée d'Orsay, was featuring the final days of its deep-discount "braderie" sale of winter clothes, getting ready for the spring line.

The book seller across the Boulevard Saint-Germain was holding its Wednesday book signings, and the outdoor food market on the Boulevard Raspail was still filled with shoppers. The little Carrefour neighborhood grocery around the corner from my apartment was fully stocked. My son, Philip, and his French wife Sarah went to a movie Thursday evening.

The French government also began unhesitatingly taking whatever measures necessary to cap the pandemic -- announcing the closing beginning Saturday of all restaurants, bars, discos, all non-essential commerce and thinning out all public transport.

From New York, Dr. Stuart Garay, my pulmonologist at NYU Langone Medical Center, had already e-mailed me, "barricade yourself like Les Misérables."

So, after listening to President Trump, I didn't wait for any of the elaboration that would follow, though I did wonder if his throwaway announcement of a travel ban at "midnight" meant 12:01 a.m. Friday morning or 11:59 p.m. Friday night. I decided that, rather than race for the airport in four hours to make a Thursday flight, I'd take a wild chance and re-book for Friday. I immediately called the American Airlines reservation 800-number and was told there'd be a 12- to 14-minute wait. I waited.

When it reached 26 minutes, I picked up my cell phone and called the French reservation number for American Airlines. By then it was well after 3 a.m., but within a minute I had an agent on the phone. After a bit of discussion, five minutes later, I had a seat on the Friday flight. The US number, after 45 minutes, was still asking me to hang on. I hung up since my free overseas calls can't go beyond 59 minutes.

Friday morning, I was at Charles de Gaulle Airport at 6:30 am. There was not a bit of traffic, though usually at that hour there are huge jams for the drop-off lanes. Inside, at French passport control, four agents sat behind their windows. There was no queue. In fact, I was the lone individual passing passport and customs. A handful of passengers were at the security check, including an American family wearing face masks, the mother with a customized (OK!) mask made from the same elaborate fabric as her dress.

On arrival at JFK airport in New York, I experienced my first-ever no wait for a Global Entry kiosk. The immigration agent, wearing a white face mask, asked two questions: what countries had I visited in the past 14 days? (France) Did I have any symptoms? (No) Moreover, no one checked my temperature, which I knew was 98.6 degrees, since I'd checked it myself before leaving my Paris apartment.

The first real shock came as I walked out of customs. It was empty. Throngs lining both sides of the exit, waiting for loved ones? None. One lone chauffeur carrying a small sign for an arriving passenger. Not a soul anywhere. The same at the taxi stand outside Terminal Eight. A long line of yellow cabs. No riders. I'd called an Uber. I was the only one at the Uber pickup point. My driver was already there waiting for me.

Clearly, a very different experience than I would have had 24 hours later. The mandatory health screening of every arriving passenger had not yet kicked in , panic had not yet reached across Europe where thousands suddenly realized, it may be now or never to get back.

I drove straight to Pennsylvania. While my wife went into the Giant food store in East Stroudsburg, I listened to Trump's news conference, which CNN's Chris Cillizza later called, quite correctly: "Donald Trump's appalling, blame-shifting Rose Garden news conference." And I thought about the contrast between the two Trump appearances this past week and the Thursday evening address to his nation by French President Macron, six hours before Trump's first, Oval Office broadcast.

Here was Macron, barely half Trump's age (42 years versus 73), acting truly presidential. By himself, in the salon d'oré (gilded room) of the Elysée presidential palace, looking reassuringly, though earnestly, into the camera, calmly telling the French people, I feel and share your pain and fear.

So, he was taking the difficult if unprecedented measure of closing all French schools from nursery to university. "Everyone has his role to play," he said firmly, excluding neither himself nor the French people, but adding a warning that was in such contrast to the words from Donald Trump.

Said Macron: "We are only at the debut of this epidemic. ... Despite our efforts to put a brake on, the virus continues to propagate and is in the process of accelerating." His words seemed to me to be preparing the French for hard measures that might lie ahead. He refused to cut France off from the world, nor from Europe, but appealed for everyone to pull together.

On Sunday, Le Monde disclosed that a study by a commission of leading scientists provided to Macron hours before his speech projected that without such measure 300,000 to 500,000 would die in France.

Contrast that with Trump's two performances: calling it a "foreign virus," refusing to accept responsibility, then surrounding himself on Friday by a cadre of others -- corporate executives, government officials -- to share the guilt and deflect all criticism. France has a smart, honest and direct leader. America has a leader who shifts with the winds of the moment, believing that nationalism and isolationism rather than globalism is the prescription to battle a disease that has already shown it respects no boundaries.

So now, here I am, writing this from my isolated little cabin out in the woods of rural Pennsylvania, where I intend to wait it all out. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) In announcing temporary travel restrictions on foreign nationals flying from Europe to the US, President Donald Trump blamed the European Union on Wednesday night for failing to take swift precautions to contain the coronavirus outbreak. In the same breath, he gave himself a pat on the back for restricting travel from China.

Laying blame at someone else's door while simultaneously taking a victory lap is vintage Trump. But had his administration implemented some of the aggressive measures taken by Singapore and Hong Kong, where the outbreak numbers remain relatively low, Americans would likely be in far safer circumstances than they are today.

What is remarkable is that, despite their proximity to and intimate associations with China, where COVID-19 originated, both cities have less than 200 cases.

In late January, Singapore, the city-state dubbed the "fine city," made the potentially painful economic decision to restrict entry from mainland China , installed extensive contact-tracing measures and ordered strict quarantines of anyone thought to have the virus.

The founder of modern Singapore, Lee Kuan Yew , whom I interviewed many times, was a well-known germophobe who had an obsession with order and cleanliness. Singapore, after all, famously banned the import of chewing gum, and levies fines for everything from littering to jaywalking. Lee and his successors inculcated into their citizens an acceptance for a nanny state whose tentacles reach into all aspects of life. When the island's younger citizens were found to be neglecting their elderly parents, for example, the government gave seniors the right to sue their offspring for "lack of maintenance."

This seems to have helped Singapore -- a major transport hub in the region -- avoid a huge outbreak of the coronavirus. As of March 12, it had only 178 confirmed cases , and no coronavirus-related deaths. Meticulous contact tracing data that is available online has established that the vast majority are local cases and that, in turn, allows authorities to identify carriers of the virus and order quarantines.

Aggressive, timely interventions are key to beating the virus.

"Two weeks of delay can mean the difference between success and failure," former Trump homeland security advisor Tom Bossert wrote in an op-ed for the Washington Post.

And, in daily press briefings, the World Health Organization (WHO) has frequently held up Singapore for its aggressive approach in tackling what it is now calling a pandemic. Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has said community transmission can be prevented "if countries detect, treat, test, isolate, trace, and mobilize their people in the response."

Even with its relatively small coronavirus caseload, Singaporean authorities continue to identify and call out the weak links in society. On Tuesday, the government scolded its citizens for socially irresponsible behavior. It noted that elderly Singaporeans, those most at risk, were still exposing themselves to the threat of the virus through line dancing and singing classes -- and introduced social distancing measures for seniors to further cut down on transmission, Health Minister Gan Kim Yong said

Well before the outbreak, the government worked closely with the private sector and community organizations and enlisted their help in implementing screening measures at events, for example.

"This is the Singapore spirit at work -- government, private sector, people sector all working together, and I believe that's the spirit that will enable us to get through this together," said Minister for National Development Lawrence Wong.

The "all-of-government, all-of-society approach" is one of the key weapons that jurisdictions can use to suppress the vectors of transmission, said the WHO's Mike Ryan

Even though younger people are believed to be less prone to infection from the coronavirus, it closed schools and universities at the end of the Lunar New Year for more than two months.

In addition to robust testing, quarantine facilities for more serious patients, and a monitoring system for those quarantined at home, Hong Kong -- having learned from the 2003 SARS outbreak that killed 299 people in the former British colony -- benefited from community buy-in to the response. Curbing the outbreak was not an easy feat, considering Hong Kong was rocked by months of anti-government protests.

Compare the level of preparation Hong Kong or Singapore has shown with that of the United States, which now has nearly 2,000 cases -- a number that is thought to be dramatically under-reported due to the low rates of testing. While President Donald Trump introduced travel restrictions from China on January 31, the US squandered the intervening weeks with confusing and inaccurate messages while continuing to cast the virus as a foreign threat -- all while failing to identify and test the growing number of cases within the country.

Hong Kong and Singapore -- which have relatively small populations of about 7 million and 5 million, respectively -- have implemented a targeted and aggressive approach to fighting COVID-19 that may not be possible in the United States, Italy and other western countries, especially when mistrust of the government is high and personal freedoms are prized. One of my expatriate friends living near the epicenter of the outbreak in northern Italy told me last week that she was shocked at how Italians were continuing to go about their normal lives and flouting the guidance from public health officials, seemingly unable to suspend their attachments to la dolce vita.

But even countries with steep increases in coronavirus caseloads can still use the lessons learned from places like Hong Kong and Singapore.

The question is, will their citizens accept potentially extreme limits on movement and other freedoms? <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) That two members of Congress (Reps. Mario Diaz-Balart and Ben McAdams) have now tested positive for the COVID-19 should not be a surprise. If anything, it's surprising we have not seen this sooner.

On Wednesday, March 11, I was in the Capitol and the three main office buildings of the House of Representatives for meetings scheduled with several members of Congress from both parties. That happened to be the day that the World Health Organization declared that the COVID-19 had become a pandemic.

Douglas Heye

In the course of planning these meetings, I made clear to the two people I shepherded through the House that, with the news surrounding coronavirus and some members going into self-quarantine, these were not normal times in the Capitol -- the buildings would be empty compared to a typical congressional workday and that handshaking would likely be at a minimum.

Boy, was I wrong.

From the very beginning, entering the Capitol, it appeared as business as usual. Congressional staff, Capitol support staff, security and reporters covering Congress were everywhere. There was no shortage of tourists. Indeed, the Capitol Rotunda was jammed with tour groups. In the Cannon, Longworth and Russell House buildings, as well as one of the House cafeterias, there were plenty of people, whether those who work in the Capitol or those just visiting.

Josh Gottheimer, a Democratic representative from New Jersey, and Tom Reed, a Republican representative from New York, are co-chairs of the bipartisan House Problem Solvers Caucus. The opinions expressed in this commentary are theirs. View more opinion at CNN.

(CNN) Nearly 50 members of Congress from the Problem Solvers Caucus — half Democrat and half Republican — spent the last week drawing up an initial roadmap with one overarching objective: We need an immediate rescue and revival plan not only to address the health crisis, but also to see the economy through the seismic earthquake hitting every American and every business today.

Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey

Rep. Tom Reed of New York

If we take the right actions now, we'll have the tools to reboot the economy and get America back to work. This earthquake was not caused by the bad actions or nefarious actions of any American. Mother Nature threw us a huge curveball and now, together, we must overcome it. These are not bailouts to anyone or to any business. We are Americans standing together with our fellow Americans.

First, we have millions of people who are suddenly out of work and with literally no income, spanning from hourly workers waiting tables to gig workers driving an Uber. The two weeks of paid family leave we passed into law will run out before we know it. That's why the Problem Solvers Caucus supports a significant expansion of unemployment insurance during the crisis, so we can get immediate, direct payments to all low-and-mid income Americans.

Second, we need to keep as many people employed as possible, or, at least, furloughed with their benefits, so they can go back to work immediately when this is over. To make that happen, we should give businesses, of all sizes, who are willing to keep or furlough their employees, access to low-or-zero interest, long-term loans. We should provide tax incentives to those businesses that are keeping their employees with health care coverage through this crisis. These actions will build on the loans we've already provided through the Small Business Administration.

Third, we need to give all Americans and businesses, who need it, the flexibility to pay their bills, including their rent or mortgage. Landlords and banks will need to get paid eventually, but Americans need a little breathing room, and delayed payment shouldn't affect credit scores -- or risk any business or anyone getting thrown out of their homes. We're glad the IRS delayed filing and payment deadlines, and that students have more time to pay their student loans -- all things we called for in our plan.

(CNN) When the president fails America, we often turn to state governors in a desperate search for leadership.

This is what happened at the start of the Great Depression. When President Herbert Hoover failed to adequately acknowledge and confront the crisis, Franklin D. Roosevelt, who was then the governor of New York, took aggressive steps at the state level, setting up an emergency relief program, for example, to help the unemployed.

This is exactly what is happening now. Millions of Americans have already upended their lives. While the coronavirus pandemic claims an increasing number of lives and cripples our economy, President Donald Trump continues to spread disinformation and attack the press , which is working to get accurate, timely information to the public.

For those who were hoping Trump might rise to the occasion, it's likely that turning point may never come. Fortunately for the country, others are stepping in to fill the void.

We have seen strong examples of leadership from governors of both parties. Despite their flaws, a number of them have shined by making bold decisions, however unpopular they may be. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) The sale by North Carolina Sen. Richard Burr and his wife of up to $1.7 million in stock shortly before sharp market declines related to the coronavirus pandemic, first reported by ProPublica and the Center for Responsive Politics, raises troubling questions that demand action by the Justice Department and Congress. Most importantly, did Burr and his wife trade on valuable insider information that he gained by virtue of his position as an elected official? If so, then Burr's conduct — profiting off mass catastrophe — is the lowest of the low. Burr is asking the Senate Ethics Committee to review his actions.

Elie Honig

In a statement, Burr said: "I relied solely on public news reports to guide my decision regarding the sale of stocks on February 13. Specifically, I closely followed CNBC's daily health and science reporting out of its Asia bureaus at the time. Understanding the assumption many could make in hindsight however, I spoke this morning with the chairman of the Senate Ethics Committee and asked him to open a complete review of the matter with full transparency."

As a prosecutor, I've learned that anytime there's a pot of money, somebody — even in the most unimaginable circumstances — will have their hands in it. I prosecuted dozens of cases against people who committed fraud to collect money intended for victims of 9/11 and Superstorm Sandy . I learned from these cases that, for some people, there simply is no bottom. Federal authorities must determine whether Burr — whose position as Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman places him in a crucial position of responsibility in our government's response to the coronavirus pandemic — engaged in conduct that violated the law and the public trust.

In 2012 , Congress passed a new law making it illegal for members of Congress to use inside information they gain through their official positions to buy and sell stock (surprisingly, such transactions were perfectly legal before 2012 unless they broke laws applying to the general public). Only three senators voted against the 2012 bill. Burr was one of them.

It's worth noting that several other senators also bought and sold stock as the economy veered toward its current downturn in recent weeks. However, Burr's sales stand out because they represented such a large portion of his stock portfolio, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. In February, two weeks after the sales, Burr offered sharp warnings about the dire potential effects of coronavirus during a private event, according to audio obtained by NPR. These remarks were in marked contrast with President Trump's public comments at the time, which suggested the virus would disappear.

(CNN) As people everywhere struggle to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus -- a pandemic that feels very much like the starting point of a new era -- another contest is unfolding over which political system is better suited to tackle the problem, and which will emerge victorious in its aftermath.

Does the pandemic prove that authoritarianism is better? Can democracy handle the challenge? The questions lie at the heart of a messaging campaign quietly flooding the world, a concerted effort to portray democracy as an inferior system.

The propaganda battle is emanating from China, where the ruling regime appears determined to leverage the pandemic to defend and promote its system of government and raise its global standing when the crisis is over.

An abundance of international media coverage about the troubles with the United States' response has boosted Beijing's propaganda effort. There is no question the US has made many grievous errors, something China's government-controlled media discusses at great length, never mind that Chinese journalists mysteriously disappeared when trying to report on it independently in their own country.

With thinly concealed glee, China's official publications enumerate the failings not only of the US coronavirus control efforts but of the American system of government, arguing that racism inequality and political divisions in America inevitably have hampered the response.

"The truth is," Beijing's Global Times asserted, the "US system is not nearly as efficient as the Chinese system."

They also take the opportunity to disparage Western criticism of China's horrifying human rights record.

Boosting its campaign, China has been shipping planeloads of aid to affected countries, widely publicizing the effort and seeking to emerge as the great, efficient and magnanimous superpower as it tries to strengthen ties with US allies, whose relations with Washington have grown strained under the current administration.

So far, with the democratic West consumed with fighting Covid-19, Beijing has had the field mostly to itself, making strides with its fabricated narrative that China is simply on a different, higher level when it comes to epidemic control.

But are dictatorships by nature better at dealing with pandemics?

The answer is simply no. While it is true that autocracies have an easier time imposing draconian measures on large populations, it is also undeniable that open societies are better at preventing the emergence of pandemics.

By covering up the magnitude of the outbreak in Wuhan early on, China's repressive practices , in fact, allowed a novel coronavirus to take root in a city, and then a province, and ultimately to spread so fast that it now infects almost every country on Earth. As has been thoroughly documented, Chinese scientists who raised the alarm about the new pathogen infecting patients in Wuhan were detained, harassed and silenced.

Laboratories that identified the virus were ordered to "stop tests, destroy samples, and suppress the news," according to independent Chinese media. The news to the public was supposed to be good; anything that might hurt the regime and its image was unacceptable. When Dr. Li Wenliang tried to spread the word, he was detained for spreading rumors. He died of Covid-19 last month.

It's no coincidence that some of the gravest mistakes in the US response were precisely the result of authoritarian instincts at play, efforts to suppress the truth and manipulate the message. When President Donald Trump spent months telling Americans that there was nothing to worry about, he arguably allowed the virus to spread more freely in the population, making the crisis worse. The epidemiologist who helped end smallpox, Larry Brilliant, called Trump's lies, "the most irresponsible act of an elected official that I've ever witnessed in my lifetime."

Does that mean democracies are incapable of preventing pandemics? Of course not. It means democracies need to elect competent, trustworthy leaders.

That is not to deny that once a pandemic does spread, tyrants have an easier hand imposing strict measures. Once China acknowledged the crisis, it launched a heavy-handed campaign to isolate and restrict movement, with some residents forced into quarantine centers and reports of coercive practices by authorities.

The method appears to have worked. New infections there, for the moment, have slowed to a trickle , according to Beijing.

But democracies have also succeeded. Countries like South Korea and Taiwan have also brought the number of cases sharply down with world-class epidemic control practices, without harsh violations of human liberties, or even a sharp reduction in economic activity.

As the contagion spreads, imposing restrictions on civil liberties creates wrenching dilemmas for open societies. That's a dilemma that dictatorships don't face.

Balancing the public good and individual liberties is a constant struggle for democratic societies. During a pandemic, the public good weighs much more heavily. Pandemics also demand a more active role for authorities, for the government. In autocracies, that only helps despots tighten their grip. In democracies, that creates friction, anxiety and push-back to protect freedom and democracy.

A case in point is Israel, whose government was one of the first to impose measures that have now become commonplace around the world, banning travel to countries with high infection rates and quarantining foreign visitors, for example. But Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who insists he's acting only to safeguard the public, is being accused of using the crisis to protect himself from his massive legal troubles and in the process putting Israel's democracy at risk.

Democracies have the challenge of protecting their values while fighting the pandemic. They try to rely on a bottom-up approach to social restrictions, hoping that the public will respond because it understands the risk, not because sinister enforcers will give them no other choice.

That's why public officials must explain the facts, plainly and clearly, without sugarcoating or sending mixed messages so that the public will trust them and heed the advice of experts. Otherwise, the system won't work. Otherwise, restrictions will require coercion, as they do in dictatorships.

Autocrats would like the world to think that Covid-19 offers proof that theirs is the better system, the system of the future. They have a weak case, and it should be forcefully rebutted. Public health does not require tyranny.

To fight a pandemic effectively, democracies must act like democracies, with openness and truthfulness. After all, defeating the virus is a battle by the people, for the people. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Jeffrey Sachs is a professor and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University . The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) As America struggles to confront the coronavirus outbreak, Washington has been consumed with getting money to households and businesses -- but the most urgent need is money in the hands of first responders: the health system, the emergency support personnel (police and others) and the social support systems that are needed for any effective epidemic control.

Congress should appropriate today at least $100 billion for immediate availability to the states and cities upon a valid request.

An epidemic is a public health emergency, not only in the sense that it affects the entire public, but in the crucial sense that public institutions -- governments and the systems that governments control -- are the make-or-break in the life-and-death battle in the coming days.

In our libertarian times, the first thought of politicians is to send money to individuals , instead of sending money to the city and state governments on the front line of the epidemic.

New York City is now the national epicenter of the epidemic, with more than 3,000 cases and rising dramatically. The true numbers of infected are much higher, as many infected individuals are left out of the current count because there has been a dire shortage of testing, many of those infected are asymptomatic and others are pre-symptomatic (with symptoms to show up in the coming days).

New York is therefore facing an onslaught of cases, unless effective control measures are put in place urgently, in hours and days, not weeks. With 8 million citizens, the epidemic there could reach unimaginable proportions in the next few weeks.

JUST WATCHED Berman: Nearly half coronavirus patients admitted to ICU under 65 Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Berman: Nearly half coronavirus patients admitted to ICU under 65 01:28

tandard epidemiological models S suggest that an uncontrolled epidemic could potentially infect more than half of New York City's population, and with hundreds of thousands of people potentially stricken simultaneously in the spring and early summer.

A study by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention showed that roughly 14% of cases in China's epidemic were severe and required hospitalization. Another study from epidemiologists at Georgia State University found that overall mortality in the Wuhan epicenter "could be as high as 20%," and around 1% "in the relatively mildly-affected areas." The implication of an overall mortality rate of around 1% could mean tens of thousands of deaths in the city in an uncontrolled epidemic.

All epidemiological estimates remain highly uncertain, but there is no doubt of the dire threats ahead.

The infection could be concentrated among people aged 65 and older, where 80% or so of the deaths occur, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, but it could also inflict illnesses including lung damage and death on younger people as well, especially those with prior conditions such as heart disease, lung disease and diabetes.

Political leaders in the states and cities must get support, first and foremost, for the public health measures needed to save New York City and countless other cities and regions across the nation from an imminent disaster.

This must be financed with utter urgency. Sending checks to individual Americans may have its role, but it is a secondary role to sending money directly to governors and mayors without another day's delay.

There are many key steps to be quickly undertaken. Most urgently: an enormous effort to reduce the transmission of the disease, especially to the older population and those with prior health conditions, but in essence for everybody. San Francisco has moved to the strategy of "shelter in place," to enable and induce the isolation of infected individuals, to break the transmission of the disease and to protect the most vulnerable among us. This is a smart approach for New York City and other areas, too.

Sheltering in place requires that all but essential workers remain at home. Special attention and support is needed for citizens older than 60 and those with prior medical conditions so that they stringently avoid contacts; they face the highest risks of death. Urgent help is also needed for the homeless and the destitute.

There is also the special need to protect frontline workers, including health care providers, emergency responders, social support workers in the community and all those engaged in provisioning the city with food and other essential needs. We also need greatly scaled-up testing and real-time online information systems.

At the same time, even with the best of control measures (and we are very, very far from the best, at this moment), we need to gird the hospitals, clinics and other health facilities, which will face an onslaught of patients in need of urgent care.

This, too, is work that is getting underway too little and too late, and without the requisite financing because of the disastrous lack of attention for several weeks by the federal government and the lack of material and financial support to date from Washington.

In sum, states and cities need immediate financing to buy equipment and protective gear, reconfigure and expand health facilities, train tens of thousands of personnel in disease control protocols for self-isolation, quarantines, and protective facilities and hire and train tens of thousands of social support workers to enable the elderly and others in isolation to survive for weeks or months.

They also need money for procuring testing equipment, creating new online apps and public services and requisitioning and refitting facilities, such as hotel rooms, to house displaced individuals.

Additional vital personnel are needed for protecting, repairing and upgrading essential infrastructure, such as telecommunications systems, and for securing vital supply chains through ports, airports and warehouses, even as most international passenger travel is canceled.

It's impossible to know in advance the precise costs of such interventions, as we take into account their rapidly evolving scope, scale and likely duration. Yet cities and states need to be able to take decisions and actions immediately, today, and without concern for the short-term budgetary consequences.

This requires that we speak here not of "stimulus," as if the policy goal were to boost an economy that we are deliberately closing down, but of "survival" and epidemic control, based on urgently needed public health and social services.

The time is short. We have lost life-saving weeks through the gross ineptitude and blithe indirection of Donald Trump -- and his administration -- and the lack of awareness and response of Congress and the federal government generally. Even now, Congress is still focusing on the economy rather than on survival.

We need to do both of course, yet the first order of business must be to fight the epidemic and save lives.

There will be time indeed for more complete budgets, audits and precision. Now is the time to act to fight the epidemic itself and to save as many lives as possible. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

Those words were pronounced by Joe Biden on Tuesday night after the results from the latest primaries had all but assured that he had clinched the Democratic nomination for the presidency. He was directing these particular remarks to the young people who have flocked to the cause of his primary opponent, Bernie Sanders.

But if they resonate deeply with me, a much older man, and give me some cautious hope for the future at this dire moment of dread and pestilence, it is due to my personal experience when I met the man who was to become Obama's vice president.

It was my one and only face to face encounter with him, many years ago. But the memory of it is sufficient for me, a staunch, though also pragmatic, supporter of Sen. Sanders and the radical need to change the fundamental injustices prevalent in the United States, to believe Biden when he proclaims that he is willing to listen to those whose views have not always coincided with his own.

It was early March 2003 and I had been flown up to New York to appear on a panel on NBC's "Today" show, as one of those who strongly opposed the upcoming invasion of Iraq. One of the other participants was then-Sen. Biden, who was there to explain why he favored the war and had voted, in October of 2002, to authorize sweeping war powers for President George W. Bush (who was claiming-- falsely, we would learn- - that Iraq's dictator, Saddam Hussein, possessed weapons of mass destruction).

JUST WATCHED John King: Joe Biden is running the table Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH John King: Joe Biden is running the table 03:19

When it came my turn to speak, I repeated the basic arguments that I had written in an oped in that Sunday's Washington Post directly to an Iraqi man who was on the panel and who wanted his country to be free as soon as possible. I said that, as a Chilean dissident who had spent decades struggling to be rid of Gen. Augusto Pinochet, I understood his suffering and that of his compatriots, but that I thought that the overthrow of Saddam Hussein by foreign forces would have terrible consequences for the world. It should be up to the people of Iraq, I argued, to oust their strongman.

It was necessary and urgent, I said, to end Saddam's reign, but not at the price of so many innocent lives lost, so many years of foreign occupation, such a grievous loss of control of Iraqis over their own destiny.

After the appearance was over, as I was being relieved of my mike by a technician, Biden walked over and asked me to elaborate on my position a bit more. He seemed genuinely interested in what I had just said, leaned in toward me, touched my shoulder with sympathy.

I told him that it was with a heavy heart that I was asking Iraqi dissidents to oppose the war that could liberate them from the everyday terror that despots inflict on their people, that I felt I could say this to them because I knew full well what it meant for those who awaited the knock on the door, who feared they would be dragged to a cellar full of tortured prisoners, who would have to deal with a legacy of persecution and exile to postpone their deliverance so that all of humanity was not dragged into a maelstrom of chaos.

Biden asked me more about my past, whether I ever would have wanted the United States, for instance, to invade Chile to help depose Gen. Pinochet. And I said that, heaven help me, I would not have accepted a devilish compromise that would have subjugated my county, even if it meant that some of my very own comrades would die before being free.

Aides to the senator were hovering around him, suggesting important business elsewhere, but he paid them no heed, and continued to ply me with questions for several minutes. He was fully engaged, and particularly concerned about the anguish that I was feeling about having to urge a powerful country not to intervene militarily to purge a foreign land of its oppressor.

I felt that he wanted to alleviate my grief, that it echoed some deep agony inside his own existence (I knew nothing then about his own family history of loss). At the end of our exchange, he said I had not altered his reluctant approval of the war that was on the horizon (he said Saddam was a threat to mankind), but he thanked me warmly for my views and promised to think about them in the impending days.

And now, 17 years later, I gladly recall that brief conversation with the man whom I fervently hope will beat Donald Trump in November and begin to rebuild the United States as a land of justice and equality and, of course, basic human kindness and decency.

For that, our candidate will, in effect, have to listen to those of us who believe, as he often has not during his long career in politics, that it is time for major reforms to the systemic inequities that plague America (and I use that word "plague" quite deliberately).

He will have to listen to the millions who are certain that the current crisis forces us to dream of a country that cares more about the problems of the many than about the profits of the few.

"I hear you," Joe Biden said Tuesday night . And added: "I know what's at stake. I know what we have to do!"

I have reason to believe that he is sincere.

And hope, for the sake of all of us in these times of catastrophe, that I am right. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) A terrified nation in the grip of a pandemic tuned into a White House briefing on Thursday and heard not a sober, confident leader, but a salesman hyping unproven treatments, boasting of non-existent achievements, and offering false hope instead of realistic counsel.

Stressing words and phrases like "rapid," "immediate" and "game-changer," President Trump made it sound as if the magic pills were in the mail and everything would revert back to normal soon. While Trump touted the use of existing drugs being tried on an experimental basis, the Food and Drug Administration Commissioner Stephen Hahn gently but firmly tempered expectations and said he didn't want to offer "false hope" given the additional research that needs to be done.

Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, made it even clearer at CNN's town hall Thursday: "Let's make sure people understand what it is. Today, there are no proven safe and effective therapies for the coronavirus...there's no magic drug out there right now."

For weeks, public health officials have been trying to convey accurate information to the American people while the President continues to spout falsehoods and misinformation. As experts predicted a rising epidemic, the President said , "We're going very substantially down, not up." When they said the worst lay ahead, he said, "It's something we have tremendous control of."

Moment by moment, the President has made us less certain and more afraid because we cannot trust what he says. He's in the grip of the "I alone can fix it" fantasy mindset that he first expressed on the campaign trail in 2016. In the past, the harm caused by this God complex was limited to problems like a government shutdown and damaged alliances. In the face of the Covid-19 pandemic, it has left us dangerously underprepared and has likely cost lives already.

At his latest news conference, the President seemed detached from reality as he pitched us on anti-malaria drugs. While early evidence suggests that chloroquine -- a drug used to treat malaria and autoimmune diseases -- may have some activity against the novel coronavirus, there is not yet sufficient clinical evidence that it is effective.

Nevertheless, Trump said, "We have a couple [therapeutic treatments] that we're in really good shape on. And that's for immediate delivery." While Hahn explained the loosening of regulations to allow for "compassionate use" so doctors can ask for approval to treat seriously ill patients with experimental drugs, he stressed the importance of additional research. He said , "That's a drug that the President has directed us to take a closer look at as to whether an expanded use approach to that could be done and to actually see if that benefits patients. And again, we want to do that in the setting of a clinical trial, a large, pragmatic clinical trial to actually gather that information."

Hahn said, "No promises can be made" and CNN's Chief Medical Correspondent Dr. Sanjay Gupta later explained , "Everybody wants to be hopeful, but we've got to exert a little bit of caution when hearing about these types of drugs. They have to be trialed like everything else."

As the number of confirmed cases in the US has surpassed 11,000 and the death toll has exceeded 150, the need for leadership -- not salesmanship -- grows more urgent. With many workers laid off, the economy has ground to a halt and people feel justifiably afraid for their health, their financial security, and for their future.

History abounds with examples of great leaders facing crises with a strength fortified by truth. President Franklin D. Roosevelt confronted the Great Depression, while Prime Minister Winston Churchill countered Adolf Hitler with realism, a sense of responsibility and honesty that inspired confidence. Trump, whose only true skill is salesmanship, is so allergic to responsibility that when asked about the obvious failings of the government's response to the pandemic, said , "I don't take responsibility at all." With these words hanging in the air, the failure to provide test kits and ensure hospitals and health care workers have enough equipment has only become more evident by the hour.

How can anyone have confidence in his or her government when the leader continues to brag in the face of widespread evidence of incompetence?

Moments after Trump boasted about his efforts and shared how proud he is of his own performance, CNN presented an emergency room doctor in Rhode Island who talked about how her hospital faces a shortage of basic supplies. "We cannot get the masks and other protective gear that we need," said Dr. Megan Ranney. Meanwhile, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has advised health care professionals to use bandanas or scarfs as a last resort if masks are not available.

warned us about for years. It must be noted that a competent government would have stockpiled protective masks and gowns and even respirators to prepare for a pandemic some experts have

Someone is responsible for this very basic failure and any other president would face the reality and own the problem. By refusing to take responsibility for such a colossal failure while simultaneously trying to drag us into his delusions, Trump is proving that he never was, and perhaps never will be, up to fulfilling his responsibilities as President.

The time has come to recognize Trump's deficiencies and tune him out. Governors like Andrew Cuomo of New York are stepping into the leadership vacuum, delivering realistic assessments of the crisis, recognizing the human toll, and counseling patience.

(CNN) As our country confronts the coronavirus crisis with a shutdown unseen in living memory, we're being reminded of some basic truths.

First, we really are all in this together, despite all our differences. The voices who divide our country into warring tribes do our country a disservice. Shared sacrifice to solve a common problem, consistent with our values, is the American way. You might even say it's what makes America great.

Second, sequestered at home with our families — away from the mad dash of social gatherings in the name of social distancing — we're reminded that they are what really matters. Playing catch in the backyard, reading a book, talking, cooking, laughing — these are the real joys of life. We should savor the simple things despite whatever fear we may feel. Because life is short. Yes, social distancing might mean missing out on some fun. But part of the tradeoff that comes with being a responsible adult is recognizing that sacrificing some self-indulgent fun can open the door to more joy.

Third, truth matters. Facts matter. And that's another way of saying science matters.

We are always safest when we confront reality and move proactively. But it's easy to be seduced by the desire to retreat into denial or try to avoid accountability. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

Where are the tests? It's the question everyone is asking, as the nation scrambles to diagnose and contain Covid-19, also known as the novel coronavirus

There is growing anger over the slow pace of testing, and some are comparing the United States' sluggish response to the more successful response of countries like South Korea , but I want to assure you we are ramping up our capabilities and working around the clock.

The limited supply of test kits has been the biggest challenge. There are only a relative few public health facilities -- less than 100 at the moment , according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention -- around the country that have been approved to perform the tests, including Northwell Health Labs, one of the nation's largest hospital labs, where I work, on Long Island in New York.

Currently, we are testing about 200 patient samples in our lab each day, using US Food and Drug Administration-approved manual and semi-automated testing systems. This has been a significant upgrade from the solely-manual testing that had been provided by the CDC, which allowed us to test about 60 individuals a day.

Semi-automated testing lets a technician inoculate a specimen taken from the nostril of a patient into a cartridge, which is then placed in a console for automatic incubation and analysis (the cartridge is something like a 1970's 8-track tape that snaps into the console like it's an 8-track player). This enables a "batch diagnosis" of several specimens every two and a half hours. When we begin operating at full capacity, over 2,000 patients a day will be tested, but we aren't quite there yet.

Northwell, for example, is working with GenMark Diagnostics, one of the first companies to get their semi-automated platform online and which received emergency use authorization from the FDA last week. But so are the other labs across the country, causing a major funnel block during a critical time.

We need to have patience.

With the limited supplies, health care providers have needed to prioritize testing the sickest patients. Of course, there are exceptions, and we have also prioritized for infection-control needs and for monitoring exposure -- especially for patient populations within hospitals, nursing homes and assisted living facilities, and also for managing health care workers' exposure to the virus.

As a country, we started late, but the full-court press is on to alleviate the effects of our delay. We're not doing enough testing because there are not enough tests out there yet.

So where are they?

Each test kit that comes off the manufacturing line has to be quality checked before it hits the marketplace. You can only rush that process so much before risking manufacturing accuracy and testing efficacy.

With Covid-19, quite frankly, we were slow out of the gate. Initially the CDC and FDA announced that they were going to create all the test kits. Because of this, none of the other labs were able to start down the pathway to develop test kits.

At that point, when it became clear that the virus was spreading faster than the CDC could deploy test kits, the FDA turned around and opened up the authorization criteria so that other laboratories, like ours, could develop their own.

Who gets tested? Testing only the sickest people has caused some panic among people who think they may have Covid-19. It's not feasible, at this point, for someone who has no symptoms but thinks they may have been in contact with an infected person to be tested. We need to focus on those who are presenting symptoms of the virus.

Aside from hospitals, physician offices and urgent care centers are where the majority of tests are being administered at the moment. Northwell is also working with New York State, mobilizing the health system's mobile phlebotomy team to perform nasal swabs in New Rochelle, which has been the epicenter of Covid-19 infection in New York. The initiative features drive-through swabbing center where patients can go to have samples collected and tested.

In response to the testing shortage, President Donald Trump announced last Friday that the FDA is creating a 24-hour emergency hotline for laboratories finding impediments to running tests, and officials are giving nearly $1.3 million of federal money to two companies trying to develop rapid-diagnosis Covid-19 tests.

I applaud these efforts and any efforts we can make as a nation and as a health care system to fast-track testing, epidemiologic surveillance and care. My fellow colleagues across the nation's health systems are doing everything and anything they can to speed accurate testing to the general public as soon as feasibly possible under our current circumstances.

Testing over the next couple of weeks is going to ramp up substantially, and you're going to see a tenfold increase in the ability to do testing throughout the country. And in another couple of weeks after that, you'll see a hundredfold increase.

Once we get there, then we will be meeting the demand. We'll get to the point soon where we will be testing for this virus just the same way we would test for any other flu virus.

(CNN) While touring the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to discuss Covid-19 a couple weeks ago, President Donald Trump asked , "Who would have thought?"

By not anticipating the catastrophe we are now living, Trump joins a pantheon of American leaders whose failures of imagination have come at great cost.

The perspective was very different in the Obama administration, where I served first in the Department of Homeland Security and then at the National Security Council as senior director for resilience policy. My work focused on preparing the United States for the hard-to-imagine -- an aerosolized anthrax attack occurring in multiple cities, destruction of core infrastructure from accelerating climate change impacts, solar flares cutting off power to the Eastern Seaboard, widespread antibiotic resistance, pandemics and other nightmare-inducing scenarios.

And I helped shape federal policy with a group that included doctors, public health experts, military officers, emergency managers and engineers.

In the wake of Ebola and Zika, for example, my team worked to reorganize the White House's approach to infectious disease to ensure that the nation was adequately prepared. As a result, the Obama administration concentrated both global and domestic policy to combat biological threats into what has recently become known as the NSC pandemic response team

Optimism bias

Preparing for catastrophic risks is crucial, but it doesn't come naturally for human beings.

In his best-selling book, "Thinking, Fast and Slow," Daniel Kahneman, a Nobel Prize winner in economics, notes that humans rely on cognitive biases -- mental shortcuts -- to make decisions and that those decisions can impede the proper assessment of an unfamiliar risk.

One bias that causes us to underprepare for catastrophic risk is optimism bias -- our tendency to overestimate the likelihood that that we will experience good events while underestimating the likelihood that we will fall victim to bad ones.

Optimism bias dominated Trump's initial messaging about the outbreak of coronavirus. On January 22, when the disease had already spread from China to several other countries and the first case had appeared in the United States, Trump said, "It's going to be just fine."

Another cognitive bias that causes us to stumble when evaluating risk is availability bias. That is our tendency to judge the likelihood of an event based on how easily we can call to mind a relevant example.

Knowing that the threat of a global pandemic might be unfamiliar to the incoming Trump administration, the Obama team organized a table-top exercise to walk their Trump counterparts through the risks of a global pandemic and familiarize them with federal response capabilities.

Tragically, once the Trump administration took charge, it allowed pandemic preparedness efforts to fall off a cliff. As Covid-19 has overtaken community after community, the nation has learned that Trump has squandered precious time to gird the nation for the devastation brought by a deadly infectious disease.

At the same time, the Trump administration failed to replenish the nation's medical stockpiles that had been depleted during a previous pandemic in 2009 and never sufficiently restocked after. In addition, it has advocated for cuts to the CDC. And the decision to build military hospitals to increase medical capacity has lagged. Given the inadequate response so far, it's not surprising the nation is now at risk of sinking to its knees.

Cost of failing to act

The failure of Trump's imagination will come at an alarming cost, both in economics and in lives.

But the government needs to more focused on preparedness. If the nation had increased spending on preparation, many lives would surely have been saved.

Once the nation emerges from this pandemic, which it will, and once Congress turns its attention to what went wrong, the nation must resolve to avoid future failures of this kind. Ignoring catastrophic risks leaves us hanging from a thread in the face of hurricane-force winds.

As Albert Einstein once observed, "Imagination is more important than knowledge." Imagination helps us move beyond what we know to confront the unfathomable. The military knows how to do this best. They test their capabilities against various scenarios, including simulations requiring the deployment of personnel and equipment to identify gaps.

We must insist that the rest of the government does the same. We must fully fund efforts to plan and prepare for future events -- events that could both exceed human memory and involve new extremes untethered to immediate experience. That includes requiring the regular updating of federal plans for catastrophic risks in coordination with state and local authorities.

It means the systematic replenishment of the nation's stockpiles of critical emergency supplies. Every government leader should have at their fingertips current playbooks detailing how agencies can readily deploy resources during a crisis response.

FEMA should conduct more frequent full-scale national exercises focused on high consequence events, all with an eye to closing capability gaps. Similarly, it should conduct community-based exercises with state and local leaders, as well as leaders from the private sector, to share information about those risks. Only then will the nation have an adequate picture of risks that are just over the horizon.

And with more climate-driven catastrophes bearing down on the nation, the Department of Homeland Security should build a more robust workforce trained in emergency response ready to surge at a moment's notice.

In short, government at all levels, in coordination with the private sector, must drive preparedness for catastrophic risk by imagining future calamities. In the meantime, Congress and its watchdog, the Government Accountability Office, must rigorously monitor the nation's progress in so doing.

Reviewing what happened

After every crippling disaster, Congress convenes some type of commission, committee or investigative hearing to find out what went wrong and what can be done to prevent future events. Each time, the conclusion reached is distressingly the same: the nation suffered a failure of imagination.

That was the finding after the Japanese surprise attack on US soil at Pearl Harbor ; so, too, after the federal government's sluggish response to Hurricane Katrina . Perhaps, most famously, the 9/11 Commission pronounced that the "most important failure" was "one of imagination."

The nation must steel itself against future failures of imagination. That means getting serious about confronting risks that seem unfathomable. Only by forcing those in charge to plan for apparently unimaginable extremes can the nation prepare.

In 1946, a committee tasked with investigating why the United States failed to anticipate the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor concluded, "Failure can be avoided in the long run only by preparation for any eventuality." By sticking to what is known and unfounded optimism, the nation puts itself at untenable risk.

To paraphrase an adage credited to Ben Franklin, by failing to prepare, the nation is preparing to fail. It's time the country put in place systems to save ourselves and our leaders from the failure to imagine. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Elizabeth Holtzman is a former four-term Democratic member of the US House of Representatives who chaired the immigration subcommittee. She is a practicing attorney in New York. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) As the global Covid-19 pandemic unfolds, it puts into sharp focus how the Trump administration's harsh immigration policies may lead to (yet another) humanitarian crisis -- this time along the US-Mexico border, where thousands of asylum seekers are living in overcrowded makeshift encampments , many without running water . If there were a coronavirus outbreak in one of these encampments -- which are already short on medical supplies -- the results could be catastrophic.

Meanwhile, the President is describing Covid-19 as a " Chinese virus " on Twitter and in news conferences, stoking xenophobia and fear -- and continuing to undermine the United States' global leadership.

It wasn't always this way. Forty years ago this week, when Sen. Ted Kennedy and I co-authored the Refugee Act of 1980 , the United States was a different country. It largely welcomed asylum seekers and refugees, and the Refugee Act reflected that humane view. In the act, our country made a permanent commitment to admitting refugees, based on the international non-discriminatory standard of fleeing persecution, and established an asylum procedure inside the United States.

The Refugee Act was not controversial. It sailed through the Senate unanimously and won overwhelming approval in the House before President Jimmy Carter signed it into law on March 17, 1980.

If Carter had a Twitter account at that time, I imagine he would have pointed to the United States' proud tradition of welcoming the most vulnerable: the 360,000 people who fled Fidel Castro's takeover in Cuba in the mid 1960s, the tens of thousands of Jewish refugees who fled the Soviet Union beginning in the 1970s, and the more than 400,000 refugees from Vietnam, Cambodia and Laos who arrived here by 1980.

If I had a Twitter account when I was drafting the Refugee Act, I would've shared my own personal reasons for supporting it. My mother and her family came to the United States as refugees in 1921, fleeing the communist takeover of Ukraine and the endless pogroms against Jews. One day, members of my family were leading a comfortable, middle class life. The next, they were running for their lives and came here with little more than the clothes on their backs.

Soon enough, with the support of organizations like HIAS, the Jewish refugee resettlement non-profit, they were on their feet. After selling woolen goods from a sidewalk on New York's Lower East Side, my grandfather established a small but successful business; my mother became a college professor and did classified work for the government during World War II; my brother became a neurosurgeon. Grateful for sanctuary here, my family has paid this country back, as countless other refugee families have and will continue to do.

From 1980 to January 2017 -- for 37 years and under six presidents -- the Refugee Act worked well. More than 3 million refugees were admitted and overwhelmingly became productive participants in our country, just as my family did.

Yet every year since Trump took office in 2017, he has slashed the number of refugees admitted under the Refugee Act. For this year, it is 18,000 , a historic low, reflecting his ongoing battle against admitting new refugees, immigrants and asylum seekers.

Refugees around the world who were hoping to start new lives in safety in the United States are (yet again) in limbo, as our government halts refugee admissions in light of the pandemic.

While limits on travel may be justifiable now, by refugees and others, I hope that this travel ban is not another assault against refugees and ends as soon as the health crisis abates.

This administration has dramatically changed us from a caring nation that provided relief to millions of refugees and asylum seekers into an angry one with xenophobic-sounding policies. It has unleashed a false narrative about dangerous foreigners that has drowned out the voices of the millions of refugees and immigrants who truly made America great.

As we face the health and humanitarian crisis brought on by coronavirus, we must recognize each other's humanity, just as the Refugee Act inspired us to do 40 years ago. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) The Supreme Court got it half right, half wrong with its decision, announced Monday , to postpone oral arguments on several pending cases, including the dispute over President Donald Trump's tax returns.

The court did the right thing by deciding not to hold in-court sessions as the nation grapples with the growing coronavirus pandemic. The current justices of our Supreme Court are, to be blunt, old. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg just turned turned 87 . Justice Stephen Breyer is 81 , Justice Clarence Thomas is 71 and the other six justices range from the 69-year-old Justice Samuel Alito down to the youngster of the group, Justice Neil Gorsuch, who is 52.

Most of the justices fall within or near the demographic group -- people older than 60 -- that is at higher risk of becoming seriously ill from the coronavirus. The Supreme Court chamber holds a tightly-packed capacity of approximately 400 . It is, in short, not a safe place to be at the moment. The same goes for other courtrooms around the country.

But the Supreme Court went too far in postponing oral arguments altogether when it easily could have conducted those arguments as scheduled through live video feed. The court's decision may well reflect a long-standing antipathy toward readily available technology that could enable it to continue doing business as usual.

Indeed, the court has long resisted efforts to place video cameras in the courtroom to provide the public with a live video feed. At a 2019 House hearing , the court offered unconvincing explanations for its reluctance to adopt modern video technology. Justice Elena Kagan said the topic of video feeds in the Supreme Court had not been discussed internally since her appointment in 2010. And Justice Alito expressed concern that a video feed could come "at the expense of damaging the decision-making process" -- without specifying how exactly live video might degrade lawyers' arguments or the court's decision-making.

But the time has now come for courts across the nation to demonstrate flexibility, to modernize and to put aside stuffy, outdated notions of judicial pomp and circumstance. Most court proceedings -- and all Supreme Court proceedings -- can be held by video conference, without legal impediment or practical downside. Attorneys can make legal arguments to judges, and parties and the public can observe and participate as needed, through video linkage.

Trials pose the only real limitation (of course, the Supreme Court does not conduct trials). The Sixth Amendment of the Constitution gives defendants the right "to be confronted with the witnesses against him." Courts have interpreted this to mean that, except in extraordinary circumstances, a defendant has the right to physically see and (through counsel) conduct live, in-person cross-examination of the prosecution's witnesses. And it would be difficult or impossible for jurors to fully observe courtroom proceedings through a video screen. Much of a juror's decision-making relies on his or her live, in-person assessment of a witness's demeanor, mannerism and credibility.

But trials are only a small fraction of what actually happens in courtrooms, day to day. Fewer than 5% of all federal criminal cases result in trials. So put trials on hold, temporarily, until we are through the coronavirus crisis, or at least the worst of it. Until then, our courts should use video conferencing technology for everything else. Crisis has a way of forcing innovation, and crisis is here.

Now, your questions:

Brad (Michigan): What legal authority does the government have to declare quarantines and how can a quarantine be enforced?

Our government has broad power to order and enforce quarantines. The federal government, acting through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), has authority to order quarantines as necessary "to prevent the introduction, transmission, or spread of communicable diseases." Using this quarantine power, HHS can order isolation of specific individuals, or can impose large-scale quarantines. The latter happens very rarely; the last mass-scale federal quarantine happened over a century ago, during the influenza pandemic of 1918-1919. All 50 states also have laws enabling governors or other officials to order quarantines.

Ideally, quarantines would be self-enforcing, and people subject to such orders would comply. But given that this is not always the case, quarantines can be enforced by fines or, in some cases, by arrest and prosecution. Violation of a federal quarantine is a misdemeanor, punishable by a fine of up to $1,000 and up to one year in prison. Breaking a quarantine order is also a misdemeanor in at least 24 states, and a felony in four states. As we may soon see, our governments have extensive power not only to order quarantines but also to enforce them.

Stuart (New Jersey): Various elected leaders have declared states of emergency. Legally, what effect do those declarations have?

Over the past few weeks, we have seen various public officials make emergency-type declarations. Here's how they break down:

Federal declaration of national emergency. a national emergency Friday. A formal declaration of national emergency has two primary effects. First, it frees up federal resources -- in this case, as much as $50 billion -- to combat the emergency. Second, a national emergency declaration can activate President Donald Trump formally declared a national emergency Friday. A formal declaration of national emergency has two primary effects. First, it frees up federal resources -- in this case, as much as $50 billion -- to combat the emergency. Second, a national emergency declaration can activate more than 100 other federal laws relating to public health, military and national defense, criminal law and other areas of federal interest.

There are more than 60 currently active national emergencies, many of which deal with emergencies that are old, obscure or narrow in subject matter. For example, one still-active national emergency dates to 1979 and prohibits certain transactions with the Iranian government. President Trump issued a controversial national emergency declaration in 2019 relating to the southern border with Mexico.

Federal declaration of public health emergency. The secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services has the power under federal law to The secretary of the Department of Health and Human Services has the power under federal law to declare a public health emergency

HHS Secretary Alex Azar issued such a declaration January 31 relating to the coronavirus. A public health emergency enables HHS to access and distribute certain federal funds and streamlines certain administrative procedures relating to contracting, investigations and hiring of personnel. A public health emergency has a narrower effect than a presidential declaration of national emergency; the former applies only to HHS, while the latter applies to the entire federal government.

State-level declarations of state of emergency. State governors hold the power to declare states of emergency. While the legal effects differ by state, generally, a state-level state of emergency does two things. First, a state of emergency can activate other existing laws. For example, it can empower a governor or other state officials to declare a State governors hold the power to declare states of emergency. While the legal effects differ by state, generally, a state-level state of emergency does two things. First, a state of emergency can activate other existing laws. For example, it can empower a governor or other state officials to declare a quarantine Some states require a state of emergency before a quarantine can go into effect while others don't.

Second, a state of emergency can cut through red tape and streamline the process of obtaining and deploying necessary aid. For example, it can eliminate procedural requirements normally applicable to state contracting (allowing authorities to obtain necessary supplies more quickly) or can suspend waiting periods or other delays usually associated with state spending and deployment of resources. A state of emergency therefore can help a state respond to an emergency situation more quickly and efficiently than normal.

Three questions to watch:

1. Will we begin to see quarantines imposed by federal or state leaders?

2. How will federal resources be deployed to assist in state and local efforts to combat coronavirus?

3. How extensively will coronavirus disrupt our normal civic functioning including courts and elections? <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
(CNN) CNN Opinion asks contributors to weigh in on the Democratic primary results in Arizona, Illinois and Florida -- and what they portend for the race ahead. The views expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the contributors.

Paul Begala: The coronavirus crisis raised the stakes

SPOILER ALERT: Joe Biden is going to be the Democratic nominee for President. Period. Full stop.

His resounding, astounding victory in Florida doesn't just send a message, it effectively ends the contest. At this writing, Biden is leading in 67 counties in the Sunshine State. There isn't a 68th. In Florida, as he has across 16 other states so far, Biden has assembled the multi-ethnic, multi-racial coalition essential for a Democratic victory in November.

Now it's up to Bernie Sanders to turn his guns -- and his millions of energetic, committed supporters -- away from the battle and toward the war. Sanders has won in many important ways: there is no doubt his candidacy has pushed the Democratic Party in a more progressive direction. But at the end of the day, as Biden said, voters want results, not a revolution.

The coronavirus pandemic has raised the stakes. Governing is no longer a reality show. Voters may no longer believe that politics is mere spectacle. It is a life and death matter. So many of the qualities that some disparaged in Biden: his calm demeanor, his refusal to demonize, his insistence on unity, his moderate instincts, his decades of experience -- they now appear tailor-made for the current crisis.

What's perhaps most comforting to me is that Democrats really believe in democracy, and they weren't about to let even a pandemic keep them from turning out to nominate Biden and, ultimately, defeat Donald Trump. Only 8% of Illinois voters and 6% of Florida voters told pollsters, in CNN's preliminary polling that began last Thursday, that the coronavirus could change their decision to vote.

American voters have often drawn on a deep reserve of courage. We voted during the Civil War. We voted during the 1918 Spanish Flu pandemic. We voted through two World Wars. And African-Americans registered and voted even when racist terrorists cursed them, beat them and murdered them.

Our economy is teetering. Our health system is tottering. But our democracy -- at least among Democrats ----is still standing strong.

Tara Setmayer: It's time for Sanders to step aside

Tara Setmayer

Joe Biden's landslide wins in Illinois and the important swing state of Florida should be the nail in the coffin for Bernie Sanders' candidacy. As primary voters in three states headed to the polls in the midst of an unprecedented national public health crisis, it's clear they decided they want former Vice President Biden to represent the Democratic Party in the November general election.

Over the last week, Biden has capitalized on the president's inept coronavirus response by presenting his own plan to combat the pandemic and doing so with a reassuring calm and confidence that comes with decades of experience and two terms as vice president.

During the recent CNN head-to-head debate with Sanders, Biden's experience and practical approach to handling the outbreak came across as sufficiently presidential. Sanders, on the other hand, seemed out of his depth when confronted with how he would respond to the current crisis.

Even with the postponement of Ohio's primary, the latest results make it almost a certainty that Sanders cannot catch Biden in the delegate count. With more primary disruptions possible due to the coronavirus outbreak, it's time for Sanders to step aside. Why subject the Democratic primary to any further unnecessary turmoil?

Dragging out the inevitable only helps Trump. The time is now for Biden to pivot to the general.

Raul Reyes: Everything about the Tuesday primaries was abnormal

Raul A. Reyes

So much about Tuesday's Democratic primaries was abnormal. There were no rallies, no in-person campaigning, no victory parties. As with everything else in American life these days, "Super Tuesday 3" was overshadowed by the ongoing coronavirus crisis. We will never know how much the pandemic affected turnout and enthusiasm, which gives any conclusions an asterisk of uncertainty.

That said, two states with large numbers of Latinos voted on March 17. According to Pew, Florida is home to 3.1 million eligible Latino voters; roughly one in five of the state's eligible voters are Latino. Arizona has 1.2 million eligible Latino voters, and they make up about a quarter of the state's electorate.

In Florida, Biden showed that he is capable of recreating the Obama coalition. The big margins he ran up in every county suggest that, as expected , Latino voters came through for him in the Sunshine State. Sanders' recent comments praising Fidel Castro's literacy programs no doubt hurt him among Cuban Americans -- and likely other Latino voters (such as Venezuelan-Americans) as well. These are voters who are simply not going to cast their vote for any candidate with the "socialist" label attached. Period.

Arizona could have been more favorable territory for Sanders, with a Latino population that skews younger and more Mexican-American than in Florida, though CNN projects Biden has won the Copper State. Now, the Vermont senator is facing the mathematical reality that he may be unable to catch up to Biden in the delegate count. While "Tio Bernie" has set a high standard for engaging Hispanic voters, he has no clear path to win the nomination.

As the likely Democratic nominee, Biden must unify the party before he can unify the country. He needs to show that he can rise to this moment of national crisis. And Biden clearly gets that: In his livestream address, Biden spoke more about the pandemic than his primary wins. He praised first responders and health care workers, then appealed to all Americans, saying , "We have to step up and care for one another." On what may be the last "normal" primary night that we know, Biden's tone was serious, sober -- and certainly presidential.

Frida Ghitis: The longer Sanders stays, the better Trump's chances of winning

Frida Ghitis

It's time for Sen. Bernie Sanders to accept that he will not be the Democratic nominee, and that continuing the fight during a global pandemic and a national existential crisis would be irresponsible. Former Vice President Joe Biden won another round of decisive primary victories, with sweeping victories in Florida, Illinois and Arizona. The electoral arithmetic shows Biden will be the nominee -- that's the inescapable fact.

From now on, every minute of Biden's attention, every ounce of energy among Democrats, is needed in the quest to deny President Donald Trump another four years in office. The longer Sanders stays, the better Trump's chances of winning.

The coronavirus catastrophe has shown just how dangerous this President has been. He has bungled the response. As much as some analysts claim the pandemic will doom Trump's reelection, the opposite could be true unless Democrats unify and focus their efforts.

And Biden has a lot of work to do to counter Trump's narrative. His speech today, streamed from his home, was blurry, discolored. Trump's daily appearances in the White House have perfect lighting, a stage, and all the accoutrements of power.

Biden has a powerful message about restoring decency and competency to the Oval Office -- and about how Trump mishandled the current crisis. But Trump has the bigger megaphone. He may drown out Biden unless Democrats can pull together. That is up to Sanders now. He should explain the stakes to his followers. This is no ordinary election; no ordinary moment.

Sanders must concede. It's time.

Chris King: Dems in the swingiest of swing states love Biden

Chris King

When I was running as the 2018 Democratic nominee for Lieutenant Governor of Florida, I had the unique opportunity to campaign alongside both Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders throughout the state. And while both men are indeed highly respected by the Democratic electorate, on Tuesday Biden undeniably demonstrated that he owns Florida, the swingiest of swing states. And there are a few good reasons why.

First, Biden connects with voters' hearts. When I campaigned with him, he outworked, outlasted and out hustled me on every rope line. He genuinely loved connecting with people -- you had to physically pull him away from voters he wanted to meet. He smiled, he listened, and most importantly, he cared.

Second, Florida hates socialism. It is ingrained in the minds of nearly every Floridian that socialism is the absence of faith and entrepreneurship -- two important forces in the fabric of the state. Sanders' decision to accentuate the positive aspects of Fidel Castro's regime (namely, his literacy program) was a disaster. Every Floridian, Democrat or Republican, knew that it was simply wrong, and his decision to double down equates to political malpractice.

Third, the power center of the modern-day Democratic Party is the black voter -- and Florida, like many southern states, has many black voters. Michael Bloomberg's $500 million and the army of "Bernie bros" could not do what South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn, the black church and working class African-American voters could.

Jen Psaki: What Biden and Sanders must do now

Jen Psaki

After tonight, a few things are clear. The Democratic primary is pretty much over. The delegate math is nearly insurmountable for Bernie Sanders.

The next few weeks will be a pivotal period for Joe Biden's team to aggressively court the troves of young people and the millions of Latinos who backed Sanders. The former vice president's message needs to be stronger, and he needs to reach out more directly to these voters.

It's also time to have a discussion about what will be in the Democratic platform. Is there language on Medicare for All? Is there language on the Green New Deal?

And it is time for Sanders to decide what he wants both in the months ahead and for his own legacy. He has millions of loyal and dedicated supporters who believe in him and will be watching his body language. He deserves to have a graceful walk off the national stage -- and the Biden team should give him that.

But with each day of the coronavirus that passes, it becomes more evident that we cannot continue with a prolonged primary process. The stakes are far too high with a national health crisis and an inconsistent and untruthful leader in the White House.

Errol Louis: Sanders approaches the point of statistical impossibility

Errol Louis

Joe Biden's powerful performance in Florida illustrates why Bernie Sanders is quickly approaching the point of statistical impossibility, when he cannot hope to match or exceed the number of delegates Biden has amassed.

Biden beat Sanders in all 67 counties in the state. In the northeast corner, he walloped Sanders by almost three-to-one in suburban Duval County, winning 66% to 23%, and by an even wider margin in the conservative panhandle in and around Tallahassee.

Biden showed similar overwhelming margins in the Democratic stronghold of Miami-Dade -- and won by double digits in each county of the crucial I-4 corridor connecting Orlando and Tampa.

The breadth of the victory is important. Biden appealed to moderate-to-conservative Democrats in the northern part of the state, progressives in the south and swing voters in the middle. He won Latino voters, a group where Sanders made inroads in California and Nevada.

This swing state famously delivered the White House to the Republicans in 2000 by 537 votes, then swung back to the Democratic column in 2008 and 2012 -- before supporting Republican Donald Trump in 2016.

Biden's win suggests he can appeal to a broad swath of Florida voters, and perhaps deliver the state back to Democrats. And by running up a big lead in the delegate count, Biden looks like the inevitable nominee.

"The math is virtually impossible now. Joe Biden is going to be the nominee of the Democratic Party," Terry McAuliffe said on CNN.

"It's over. The election is over tonight. That's very clear," said David Axelrod, Obama's chief campaign strategist.

That may be a bit premature, but Biden is well on his way to the nomination, and he has the Sunshine State to thank for a massive boost.

SE Cupp: Dems need a nominee they can get behind

SE Cupp

Tolerance among Democrats for Bernie Sanders' vainglorious and obstinate exercise in futility must be running out after Joe Biden's projected wins in Florida and Illinois. With no conceivable path to the nomination for Sanders, and a report earlier today in the Daily Beast that he does not plan on quitting after tonight, expect the frustration among Democratic operatives and even voters to grow more vocal.

Sanders is performing WORSE in some counties and states than he did in 2016, vaporizing his only selling point, which was that he could grow and expand the Democratic base. He is not; he cannot. Add to this, of course, the fact that we are in the middle of a pandemic and global health crisis, and it makes his refusal to step aside even more painful and self-centered. Whether you like Biden or not, Democrats need a nominee they can galvanize and coalesce behind. And America deserves an election with a clear choice.

Scott Jennings: Democrats are turning out -- but so are Trump voters

Scott Jennings

Much has been made of the increased Democratic primary turnout , and it is true -- Democrats are turning out in 2020 in higher numbers than they did in 2016 (a stark reminder of what a mediocre candidate Hillary Clinton really was).

But not to be overlooked is the turnout President Donald Trump is generating in the Republican primaries . Trump's wins don't get as much press, but the essentially non-competitive nature of his primary makes his huge vote totals all the more interesting. He's racking up massive tallies compared to Barack Obama in 2012 and George W. Bush in 2004:

In New Hampshire , Trump did 129,696 votes, or about 2.5 times what Obama got in 2012.

In California , Trump, with 2.1 million votes, just about matching Obama's raw total in 2008 and 2012 and they are still counting the votes.

Alabama, Arkansas, Massachusetts, Mississippi, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Texas -- the story is the same everywhere. Despite having no serious opposition, Trump is racking up enthusiastic GOP turnout across the country. This metric is backed up by a January Associated Press poll which found "Democrats are nervous wrecks and Republican excitement has grown," ahead of the November election

Trump has a clearly excited and galvanized party behind him, along with a massive fundraising machine that brought in $86 million in February and $607 million since the beginning of 2019. Despite national polling showing him lagging a bit behind Joe Biden, the all-but-certain Democratic nominee, the president is not to be counted out when you consider the operation and party enthusiasm behind him.

Alice Stewart: Coronavirus is dictating who the primary winner is

Alice Stewart

Leadership in the era of the coronavirus pandemic is clearly on the ballot for voters in Florida, Illinois and Arizona. Before Super Tuesday 3.0, the choice for Democratic voters was moderate vs. progressive. At the height of the coronavirus scare, the driving force for voters appears to be who can they trust to handle a major crisis. And, according to CNN primary polling , voters trust former Vice President Joe Biden over Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Those numbers are playing out in the ballot box, as Biden is the projected winner in Florida and Illinois.

Biden made a strong case for his ability to lead in tumultuous times during the CNN debate over the weekend. He carried a tone of reassurance and resolve in a time of crisis. Sanders was business as usual -- angry and defensive.

It's no longer about policy contrast -- it's about leadership contrast. In these times, voters want more than someone who touts Medicare for All, the Green New Deal and free college tuition. They want someone who they believe will bring the party together in the primary -- and bring the nation closer together in November.

Democratic voters believe Biden is that person.

With Biden leading by more than 200 delegates, the question is now not if Sanders will get out, but when.

Jon Talton: Biden's win puts Arizona in play for Dems

Jon Talton

Joe Biden's win in the Arizona Democratic primary makes him a bigger threat to President Donald Trump when the Grand Canyon State votes in the general election. Trump won Arizona by 48.1% to Hillary Clinton's 44.6 % in 2016.

If, as now looks almost certain, Biden becomes the party's nominee, he has a chance to swing the state's large independent voter base towards the Democrats.

Two large questions will be answered in the general election, as Trump seeks to repeat his 2016 Arizona win. Has an influx of Californians changed the state's political make-up? And will historically low Hispanic voter turnout change, as a rebuke to Trump's border wall and anti-immigrant policies?

Key factors to consider: Arizona's massive population growth hasn't changed its steady drift to the right. Republicans have controlled the powerful legislature for decades. And the anti-immigrant policies of the notorious former Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio, as well as the state's controversial SB 1070 "papers please" immigration legislation, failed to produce a Hispanic voter backlash.

True, Arizona's congressional districts are now evenly split, and the state has a Democratic Senator with Kyrsten Sinema — but she's a "blue dog" conservative, not a "revolutionary."

Still, Arizona has an independent streak. Trump's unpopularity might give Biden a better chance than a progressive candidate like Bernie Sanders would have had.

Nayyera Haq: Sanders' key voting blocs fail him again

Nayyera Haq

The fact that young people in Florida were flocking to beaches while much of the country is shutting down to prevent a pandemic from spreading further tells you a little about the priorities of a key Bernie Sanders voting bloc. The youth may have championed Sanders online and at rallies on college campuses, but once again they did not turn out to support him at the polls when it counted. Meanwhile, older voters and black voters handed Biden a decisive win in Florida.

Tio Bernie has had some success with Latino voters thus far, netting 53% of the Latino vote in Nevada . But he came up against the diversity that exists within communities of color in Florida. Of the Latinos in Florida, 1.2 million claim to be of Cuban descent , and many of them identify as exiles from Fidel Castro's regime.

No matter how accurate the statement, they would not have appreciated Sanders' praise of the Castros' literacy programs. And, in a state like Florida, where voters in both parties are keenly aware their state helps decide Electoral College victories, language that turns off a significant voter population can be decisive.

This is the ongoing rhetorical challenge that has hampered Sanders when it comes to the delegate math needed to win the nomination. He tries to speak his own version of truth to power, but it isn't necessarily what power brokers or voters are interested in hearing <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) As the federal and state governments grapple with the potential effects of the Covid-19 pandemic across the nation, there has been an increasing call for mobilizing the military to contribute to the pandemic response. In a New York Times opinion piece , New York Governor Andrew Cuomo suggested that the Army Corps of Engineers should be called into service to assist to "retrofit and refit existing facilities" to serve as temporary medical centers

Indeed, the Joint Staff received approval from the Secretary of Defense early in February to refresh their contingency plans for the "response, isolation, quarantine, restriction of movement and community-based intervention" of any potential pandemic. But what does all that actually mean for our country's citizens and government officials as we address the anxiety associated with the coronavirus? What can the military contribute?

Having once served as the J7 on the Joint Staff -- leading the staff office that reviewed contingency (or "war") plans - and also having served as a commander of forces that contribute military personnel to support civilian authorities, I have a pretty good idea of what the military can and can't do as they are tasked to contribute to the overall response.

Whenever military forces are given the mission to "provide support to civil authorities," the Secretary of Defense, Joint Staff and the Commander charged with the mission first consider two competing requirements: how does the military force continue to maintain readiness for their priority task of defending the country, and what forces could the military provide that could be mobilized and that would best contribute to the department -- in this case, Health and Human Services -- requesting the support?

Governor Cuomo suggests that the Army Corps of Engineers -- a force of approximately 37,000 civilian and soldiers spread all over the world -- could assist in overhauling and renovating hospitals.

The Corps is a terrific and professional organizatio n. With an "all-hands on deck" order, the Corps could certainly contribute, but in a very limited capacity, to establishing and reinforcing health care facilities. Those available forces in the US would need prioritization by the Secretary of Defense and would likely be stretched to provide the kind of support desired in more than just a few cities.

There have also been suggestions that the military could provide medical personnel to support civilian authorities. This is certainly a possibility. While I was serving in Europe in 2005, the US Army in Europe (USAREUR) received a request from the US State Department to send a Combat Surgical Hospital (known as a CSH, an acronym slightly changed from the famous Mobile Army Surgical Hospitals, or MASH's, of the past) to support a humanitarian relief operation in Pakistan.

JUST WATCHED Military leaders on what war can teach us about fighting coronavirus Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Military leaders on what war can teach us about fighting coronavirus 02:37

That unit had just returned from Iraq, and had already been tasked to head to Afghanistan, so it was necessary to weigh their military mission against providing support to civilian authorities. This small hospital was deployed and treated over 80,000 patients in a period of a few months. But there are caveats to this kind of mission.

In an excellent piece on this topic Sunday , CNN reporters outlined various aspects of mobilizing the limited active and reserve elements of the military's medical command structure to support civilian authorities.

One thing not addressed, though, was that mobilizing reserve or National Guard health care providers for duty would likely take them away from the civilian hospital from whence they came, as most doctors and nurses in the guard and reserve work full-time in the civilian health care industry.

What's more, a large percentage of our military - Army, Navy, Air Force, Marines, as well as doctors, nurses, hospitals and engineers - are stationed overseas. After discounting those, there are about a million-plus "military forces" stationed throughout the United States. All of those are skilled military personnel trained in a variety of jobs and functions, from infantry, artillery, submarine crew, to fighter and bomber airplane mechanics.

Very few of these individuals have the kind of specific skills -- as health care workers or construction engineers, for example - that many politicians need and are now demanding.

To get the kinds of specialties that would best contribute to the pandemic fight would require stripping units of their trained personnel who contribute to other missions. Do we want to close the clinics in Germany, Korea and Japan (and other places), close the hospitals and clinics that support our forces in combat, while bringing home medics from Afghanistan, Iraq, and other places where we're operating?

Do we also understand that there are a very limited number of hospitals and clinics - less than 1% of the hospital facilities currently in our civilian population - where over 2 million family members go for health care?

Additionally, when considering using the Army Corps of Engineers, would the American people be okay with suddenly pulling those who control and service the dams, waterways, flood plains, parks and major construction sites and projects, where a relatively small group of soldiers and civilians are keeping operations safe, and focusing their talents on a relatively few number of locations?

These are the kinds of questions that demand analysis and answers from those in the Pentagon when anyone suggests the sweeping demand that we must "mobilize the military!"

It becomes readily apparent: asking for military forces is never a straightforward or easy "ask."

There are, however, some tasks the military can be mobilized to perform that would significantly contribute to mitigating the Covid-19 pandemic. Primarily, the military could assist with command and control of operations and functions, given that commanders and their staffs continuously practice managing information and deliberations regarding crisis decision making.

Additionally, the military -- both active and reserve forces - are extremely good at logistics, transportation and supply chain activity. Lt. Gen. Russ Honore's actions as the commander of Joint Task Force Katrina is a perfect example of how a military commander can contribute to both command and control as well as logistical support that contributes when mitigating and reducing a crisis.

During the Ebola crisis, America's military provided additional support --under a two-star general -- by establishing a facility in West Africa to train doctors from all over the world before they entered the "hot zone."

Given that medical experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Protection and the Department of Health and Human Services predict that the country's inventory of doctors, nurses and clinicians will soon be overwhelmed by the stresses associated with the pandemic, the military could help to establish a similar training facility that would prepare the next group of health care providers on procedures for addressing various factors of the disease before they "enter the fight," like what was done in Africa

But again, these kinds of command and control, staff and logistical capabilities and training preparations -- and the number of headquarters available and generals trained in contributing to these kinds of responses - are limited. But the Department of Defense will parse them out and provide what is needed to best support the American people.

It's important to understand that part of any communication plan addressing crisis response must incorporate a transparent approach to what the military can do ... and what they call "the art of the doable." For those uninitiated with military operations or military personnel, resources and abilities, it's appropriate to outline exactly what the civilian authority is asking for, what might be provided ... and what is beyond the capacity of those wearing the uniform.

There are things the military can do, and there are things that are just not aligned with feasible or viable actions.

From experience, I know that the Pentagon knows what they might be able to provide, and they are willing to push the envelope to give what will contribute to defeating this pandemic. That's something they've done in the past and what they are prepared to do in any emergency.

The first step comes, though, when civilian authorities first provide a strategy, request the task that needs to be accomplished and elaborate on the tasks they need the military to perform. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) When Donald Trump wants to rally his base and distract from his many screw-ups, he falls back on one thing: xenophobic racism.

It looks like members of his administration have picked up this dirty trick.

Earlier this week, CBS reporter Weijia Jiang (disclosure: she is a friend) tweeted that a member of the Trump administration had called the coronavirus "Kung-Flu" when talking to her. She is Chinese American. "Makes me wonder what they're calling it behind my back," she wrote.

Trump himself sent out a tweet Monday calling Covid-19 "the Chinese virus," and then repeated it Wednesday as he began a televised news conference in which he invoked the Defense Production Act. It's an intentional bit of provocation and racism that evokes the turn-of-the-century "yellow peril," when Americans and Europeans fear-mongered about allegedly dangerous East Asians.

In 1882, the United States passed the Chinese Exclusion Act, which barred Chinese immigrants from coming to the country -- not so very different from Trump's own racist and fear-mongering 2017 travel ban that predominantly targets Muslim-majority countries.

Reactionary media, self-interested political figures and racist whites portrayed East Asians as dangerous "others" back then, and blamed Chinese people for taking "white jobs." (Is any of this sounding familiar yet?) The result? Decades of discriminatory immigration policies, discrimination in housing and education and violence against Asian people, including mass atrocities.

JUST WATCHED Don Lemon: President Trump is gaslighting you Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Don Lemon: President Trump is gaslighting you 12:12

Pandemics are frightening because you can't see a virus. Throughout human history, rampaging illnesses have regularly been blamed on some outside force, from God sending down a pestilence, to -- more often -- unfamiliar outsiders or unpopular minorities allegedly bringing in disease, along with other traditions and practices that the dominant group is quick to deem dirty or morally wrong. European Jews were blamed for the Black Death and massacred.

People living in rural areas have blamed city dwellers for polio ; HIV was initially blamed on gay men. Scapegoats and new diseases have often gone together, often to lift blame from the people in charge.

When there's a lack of information, you understand why everyday people grasp at the nearest possible explanation. But the President of the United States? There's no excuse. The President's indirection and obfuscation in the face of scientific evidence has put citizens at risk, as he invites them to think of the disease as "Chinese" and not a wholly American crisis sweeping our nation.

This President isn't acting out of ignorance; he's acting out of malice. He has screwed up the coronavirus response royally, downplaying the threat with ludicrous pronouncements in front of TV cameras, while his health care officials issued grave warnings. He said it will pass soon, that warm weather will help and other nonsense. On January 30, he said , "We only have five people. Hopefully, everything's going to be great."

On February 2, he told Sean Hannity of Fox News : "Well, we pretty much shut it down coming in from China. ... We've offered China help, but we can't have thousands of people coming in who may have this problem, the coronavirus."

Americans are sick and dying -- and it's going to get worse, in large part because of the administration has been slow to make testing available. For this, he said in a recent news conference, "I don't take responsibility at all." But he knows someone has to shoulder the blame.

So he blames a "Chinese virus." A reporter asked him Wednesday why he keeps calling it this. He replied , "'Cause it comes from China. It's not racist at all, no, not at all. It comes from China, that's why. I want to be accurate."

He added -- making plain that even in a national emergency, it was revenge, not accuracy or the safety and well-being of citizens that was on his mind -- "I have great love for all of the people from our country, but as you know, China tried to say at one point ... that it was caused by American soldiers. That can't happen, it's not going to happen, not as long as I'm President. It comes from China."

And, of course, China being an authoritarian state hasn't helped. As much as some are trumpeting the ability of the Chinese to quickly lock down millions, the real story is that t he Chinese government did as authoritarians do: They misled, withholding information from the public until the crisis was at full tilt. Anyone in the chain of command who thought this was the wrong thing could not, or did not, speak out. (A Chinese official did indeed blame the presence of the virus in Wuhan on the US military.)

It's that strategy that Trump, troublingly, is adopting, as he also falls back on his usual tactic of blaming someone else.

Nayyera Haq: Biden shows he can evolve

The challenge with having two septuagenarian, long-term senators on the debate stage is that serious discussion of the big issues facing the country so easily devolve into tirades about decades-old votes and political squabbles. Bernie Sanders reminded all of us that his once radical ideas have now become mainstream parts of the political conversation. But it was Joe Biden, "coming around now," on his adoption of Senator Elizabeth Warren's bankruptcy proposals, his rejection of the Hyde Amendment and his adoption of free public college for families earning less than $125,000, who showed that he is capable of listening and evolving.

When a moderator asked for a commitment to having a woman as vice president on the ticket, the candidates' relative ability to adapt in response to feedback was clearly on display. Biden's answer was an unequivocal yes, followed by a commitment to appointing a black woman to the Supreme Court. Biden used the debate platform to make a first-time declaration aimed at assuaging the female voters who have been disheartened by seeing the debate stage narrow from five female candidates to zero, while also acknowledging that black women are the backbone of the Democratic party.

Whether it was a calculated declaration does not change the fact Biden is committed, which stands in sharp contrast to Sanders' answer: "In all likelihood, I will...for me, it's not just nominating a woman, it's making sure we have a progressive woman."

At a time when many Americans are panicked about the present, moving out of debating policies of the 1990s was critical for both candidates. Sure, Sanders proved that he was the purer, more progressive candidate -- we knew that. Biden consistently stayed focused on the future, with plans he would enact and what he would do differently than Trump. If Biden continues to look forward and embrace ideas from the left, he will show voters that he can do what he has talked about all along -- be the consensus candidate that brings Democrats to the White House in 2020.

Raul Reyes: A welcome discussion of immigration

Raul A. Reyes

The good news from Sunday night's debate is that both Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders delivered spirited presentations of their ideas, and each gave a preview of how he might take on President Donald Trump. Biden needed to demonstrate that he can be effective in a one-on-one debate. Sanders needed to contrast his progressive ideas with that of his rival. Done and done. Democrats can take heart: Biden had his strongest debate performance to date, while Sanders showed that he is not about to cede the nomination without a fight.

At its best, this debate showed both candidates' strength on issues like the coronavirus crisis and immigration. Biden asserted that any person who needed testing or treatment for the coronavirus "would be held harmless," regardless of immigration status, adding that women who are the victims of domestic violence should not be deported. He also committed to a moratorium on deportations (except for felons) for the first 100 days of his administration.

Sanders noted that undocumented people would be covered by his Medicare for All proposal, and that he intends to stop ICE raids. This immigration discussion was good, as the topic has not been substantively discussed in the last few debates -- and the eventual nominee will face a president who has made immigration his signature issue. Kudos to both candidates for defending the legal right of asylum-seekers to seek humanitarian relief at the border.

At other points, this debate devolved into unproductive bickering. Right now, the public is anxious, and the back-and-forth sniping was not a presidential look for either candidate. Biden said it best when he declared, about he and Sanders, that "we don't disagree on principles."

The lack of a live audience turned out to be a plus, as it left more time for the debate itself, and the candidates could not rely on applause lines. It was also a highlight to see Ilia Calderon, who is Afro-Latina, as a moderator -- an important reflection of the diversity of the Latino community.

Frida Ghitis: Biden makes big news on his running mate

Frida Ghitis

For once, the loser by a mile in the Democratic debate was Donald Trump. Former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders offered presentations that were more reasonable, coherent and factual than anything the President has managed while reading a speech from the teleprompter or speaking from the podium. The contrast with a president floundering in a national emergency was striking.

If Trump was the loser, the clear winner was Biden. The former Vice President made news, announcing he will choose a woman as his vice-presidential running mate (clear your calendars Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar).

Gone is the Biden who seemed lost on a crowded debate stage. This debater was crisp, calm and cogent through the entire two hours. As the hours passed, he never lost his focus and remained totally articulate. He should be careful; he might lose the benefit of low expectations.

Biden made few major gaffes -- except perhaps for parts of his China answer, but that may have been calculated. He looked confident and relaxed. If his body language was planned, it worked. His quarter-turn toward Sanders, with one hand in his pocket, made him look both in command and approachable.

While Biden came across as profoundly compassionate and pragmatic, Sanders, who has been consistently strong in articulating what is wrong with America, remained hyper-focused on his ideological, revolutionary position. Sanders did himself no favors by refusing to agree with Biden's suggestion that the two Democrats share similar goals diametrically opposed to Trump's ("details make a difference," Sanders said); refusing to fully commit to choosing a woman running-mate ("My strong tendency is to move in that direction") and initially seeming dismissive of the Paris Climate Accord ("Who cares").

With the country facing a huge challenge, and the current President leading a dangerously chaotic response, one can only wonder why Democrats don't move on to unify the party without delay. This should be the last debate. That would be the biggest loss for Trump.

Van Jones: Democrats need a dose of Biden and Sanders to win in November

Van Jones

Neither wing of the Democratic Party got what they wanted tonight: neither a knock-out blow for Vice President Joe Biden, nor a comeback shot for Sen. Bernie Sanders. But both were well-represented.

On issue after issue, Sanders made it clear he understands the depth of America's need for big solutions. He noted that the seeds of today's COVID-19 response failure were planted in a broken healthcare system years ago. He showed that the progressive agenda can help Americans who are barely holding on when work no longer pays. He pressed Biden on the flaws in his record. And the exchange on climate showed how Sanders -- along with New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and the Sunshine Movement -- finally forced our nation's leaders to think big about facing the existential threat of the climate crisis.

In moment after moment, Biden made it clear he understands the depth of America's need for hope and normalcy. He passed up a debate over the politics of Medicare for All to talk about uniting the country around an urgent plan to stem the threat of coronavirus. He spoke to millions of too-long-overlooked women -- and women of color -- when he promised to pick a female running mate. This follows the former Vice President vowing to choose an African-American woman for the Supreme Court. And Biden went further on climate than many Democrats were willing to go just a few years ago -- during the Obama administration.

The first 15 minutes on coronavirus might have been the most important of the debate. Biden was empathetic and unifying. Sanders was unflinching in his diagnosis of the deep problems and the big solutions. Both represented themselves well. Democrats will need some of both to beat Trump in November.

Jen Psaki: Biden's handling of a crisis sounded presidential

Jen Psaki

Former Vice President Joe Biden and Senator Bernie Sanders knew that the focus of tonight's debate would be on the crisis that is dominating not just the United States, but the global community.

Both were significantly more clear, coherent and thoughtful than the current President of the United States. But their approaches were different.

Biden focused on his experience and ability to address this crisis right now.

Sanders focused more on how his ideology would help address what happens after coronavirus.

Both are important. I have no doubt Joe Biden knows exactly what to do during a crisis. He lived through eight years of them in the White House, including health crises.

And I have no doubt that Bernie Sanders would continue to be a voice for the millions of people who are worried about what happens when the crisis is over.

But at a time when families are worried about whether grandparents are safe, kids are asking hard questions to answer about why they can't hug their friends, and President Trump continues to mislead and scare the public, Joe Biden's focus on what he would do about the crisis right now was a smart reminder of what a real President sounds like.

Peter Bergen: Biden focused on the here and now of the coronavirus crisis

Peter Bergen

Obviously, the question of who might better handle the coronavirus crisis was front and center in the debate between former Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders.

Sanders rightly said it was time for President Donald Trump to stop "blabbering" about the coronavirus and confusing the general public. Indeed, Trump has made multiple misleading statements about the crisis, not least just hours before Sunday's debate when he said that the US government had "tremendous control" of the virus. This is, of course, patently not the case.

During the debate, Biden returned often to his role in mitigating the Ebola crisis in 2014, which doesn't seem that relevant since Ebola posed nothing like the scale of the threat that the US faces with coronavirus. Biden also deployed the bromide that he would assemble experts in the Situation Room at the White House to deal with the crisis, which is a lot like saying "we will study the problem."

But overall Biden did better on the question about what to actually do now about the coronavirus. When CNN's Dana Bash asked Biden if he would call in the US military to help, Biden was clear that had would indeed do so to build additional hospitals, which could well be necessary, given that hospitals may be overwhelmed as the crisis deepens.

Sanders ducked the same question, instead concentrating on his Medicare for All proposal, which is all fine and good but is not the kind of policy proposal that will help with the immediate crisis.

Biden also called for immediate testing for the coronavirus among vulnerable seniors in nursing homes. Again, this is the kind of practical proposal that is needed right now as the crisis deepens.

Alice Stewart: Substance and style in the midst of coronavirus

Alice Stewart

With former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders facing off in the Democratic primary debate, it was the coronavirus pandemic that took center stage. There were two key takeaways for those tuning in: what the candidates had to say about the national emergency, and how they said it.

Biden laid out his plan for taking care of those exposed to the virus and providing more access to testing for all.

Sanders avoided details of a response plan, opting instead to voice his desire to "shut this president up right now." As expected, Sanders also used the coronavirus outbreak as an example of why his Medicare for All plan is necessary.

In contrast, Biden was effective in making the case that Medicare for All is the wrong way to address health care in general, and it "would not solve the problem at all" when it came to COVID-19.

Biden carried a different tone, full of empathy, and acknowledging the serious times we are facing. Sanders' delivery was similar to past debates -- pushing progressive policies and insulting President Donald Trump.

It was a strong debate for Biden -- not only because of what he said, but also because of how he said it.

Julian Zelizer: The divide between parties has never been clearer

Julian Zelizer

The contrast between parties was apparent right off the bat. Whereas President Trump has spent much of his time amid the coronavirus crisis speaking about how great things are, or spreading disinformation, both former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders took a very different path. They expressed their empathy for those who have suffered from the virus, talked about real and immediate policy needs—such as widespread testing—and spoke about the economic fears of working Americans.

Although many issues divide these candidates, together they displayed a fundamental difference on where the parties stand in 2020. Democrats remain concerned with governance, value expertise, and focus their attention on how public policy can help the lives of Americans. Republicans are operating in a Trumpian world of disinformation where institutions are not taken seriously and the work of running a government is no longer a priority.

The severity of the crisis that the United States now faces has elevated—in ways we could not have imagined — the political value of a party that stands for these principles.

Biden's commanding lead and his solid debate performance tonight in his first one-on-one debate will greatly benefit his larger campaign. The value of his experience in the White House has greatly increased in value since the last time the Democrats met on the debate stage.

The image of the party, as well as his leadership style, makes him stronger than at any point in this race. Americans are watching this debate as their cities and towns close down. Biden's ability to simply govern and run a stable White House will now seem to move voters as much as the ideas that Sanders offers.

Sarah Isgur: Democrats are experiencing déjà vu

Sarah Isgur

With the first half hour of the debate focused entirely on the public health crisis facing the country, Sanders' traditional economic populism message never found a solid footing. Instead, in an unusually uneven performance, he struggled and stumbled to answer questions about how he would respond to the current crisis, including whether he would deploy the military and how he would respond to China's initial suppression of information related to the coronavirus outbreak.

But 45 minutes in, Sanders hit his stride in one area -- direct and sustained attacks on the frontrunner Joe Biden, challenging the Vice President on taking money from Super PACS, as well as voting for the bank bailout and the Iraq War.

For Democrats, this may feel like déjà vu all over again.

Following a string of disappointing primary results -- and with more losses on the horizon in states like Florida and Arizona this Tuesday -- Sanders is facing the reality that it is becoming a near mathematical impossibility for him to receive enough delegates to secure the nomination. This has caused many leaders in the Democratic Party to raise concerns that Sanders' continued presence in the race could inflict lasting damage on Biden heading into the general election.

The concern isn't a new one. In an interview after her 2016 loss, Hillary Clinton said Sanders' continued attacks on her "caused lasting damage, making it harder to unify progressives in the general election and paving the way for Trump's 'Crooked Hillary' campaign." That year, millions of voters for Barack Obama in 2012 either voted for Donald Trump or stayed home.

The Democratic Party's first priority is to beat Trump in November. But Sanders' attacks on Biden tonight may have been a little too reminiscent of 2016 for those who want to win back the White House.

Scott Jennings: The two didn't exactly cover themselves in glory

Scott Jennings

I was surprised that the two candidates didn't walk out and at least have some prepared show of collegiality or unity. No, this debate opened and unfolded like this: Joe Biden wanted to knock out Bernie Sanders once and for all, and Bernie Sanders was not having it and very much believed he was still alive and viable for the nomination.

I assumed Biden would just pretend he's the nominee and largely ignore and/or pat Sanders on the head, but he did not, instead repeatedly denigrating Sanders' signature health care plan: Medicare for All. By the end of the first hour, they were arguing about the size of their donations and how many Super PAC's they dealt with, about which no American gives a flying flip as they prepare to face their new coronavirus realities.

Hard to know what to make of the first hour: Biden, prone to misspeaking and bungling lines, had a bizarre few seconds when he mixed up coronavirus and swine flu, then called the swine flu "N1H15," and then apparently forgot the word "Ebola" by referring to "what happened in Africa," a moment the Trump campaign was all too happy to amplify. Sanders then went off for a few seconds referring to coronavirus as "Ebola," appearing hung up on the term.

I assume that because Biden is better at platitudes and pablum, he'll be judged the winner, while Sanders will be judged to have failed to move beyond the issues that motivate his base -- but not the broader Democratic electorate. Honestly, though, I am not sure either covered themselves in glory as this two-man debate kicked off. Sanders landed the toughest blows with his challenge about whether Biden had once talked about the need to cut Social Security and Medicare -- an exchange I bet the Democratic National Committee wish hadn't happened.

SE Cupp: Biden and Sanders should stick to criticizing Trump

SE Cupp

When Bernie Sanders and Joe Biden were focused on Donald Trump's lack of leadership and the urgency of now, they both shined. When they descended into squabbles over old votes -- whether it was Biden's Iraq War vote or Sanders' gun votes -- they both looked small and really out of touch.

They need to understand and quickly adapt to the fact that there are new rules -- the ground underneath them has changed. The pandemic and resulting fear and chaos mean they need to pick new fights and leave the old ones behind.

Whatever plans they had to take each other and Trump on should be discarded for campaigns centered around the need for a calm and steady hand, experience, a commitment to expertise, transparency, truth and strength. Voters are laser-focused on Trump's ability to guide them through this unprecedented health crisis, and whatever Sanders or Biden are talking about should keep that top of mind.

Aaron David Miller: Why Biden won the debate

Aaron David Miller

Tonight's debate reflected the different realities confronting the Biden and Sanders campaign. Vice President Joe Biden -- whose campaign is surging -- knew exactly what he wanted to do: act presidential. The other, Bernie Sanders -- whose campaign is in jeopardy and who may well drop out of the campaign soon -- didn't and it showed. Winner? Joe Biden.

Who looked presidential? The debate was essentially won in the first 25 minutes during their discussion of the key issue on Americans' mind tonight -- coronavirus. Biden sounded and acted like a president -- "we're at war with a virus." Sanders' responses sounded like those of a policy wonk -- a wash, rinse and repeat of his commitment to Medicare for All, untethered from the national crisis we face now.

Demeanor: Biden was as articulate and fluent as he's been in any of these debates, looking stunningly comfortable with few glitches and goofs. In contrast, Sanders too often seemed annoyed, irritated and, at times, angry.

Moving Biden to the left: If Sanders' objective was to try to move Biden to the left on key issues such as income equality, taking money from big corporations, climate change and health care, he failed. Meanwhile, Biden may have missed a few opportunities in reaching out to Sanders supporters on an issue such as climate change.

Democratic unity: Committed to unifying the Democratic Party to beat Trump, there wasn't much of an effort on either man's part to do that tonight. There was a good deal of hot debate and mutual attacks likely to push supporters of Sanders and Biden farther apart. It's very much an open question whether Sanders' supporters won't come around easily and could stay home instead of voting.

Charlie Dent: Solutions or revolution?

Charlie Dent

In the midst of the coronavirus pandemic, the candidates at Sunday night's debate presented a clear contrast, more in style than substance -- with Joe Biden speaking in reassuring terms, while Bernie Sanders ranted on themes we have heard from him for decades.

Sanders absurdly used the immediate COVID-19 crisis to advocate for Medicare for All and a single payer system as a solution. Biden called Sanders out by pointing to Italy's single payer system and its irrelevance to their country's inadequate response. Further, the former Vice President offered specific policy responses to the immediate crisis, while Sanders kept touting Medicare for All and warning about "profiteering" pharmaceutical companies. He called the very companies we are demanding to develop lifesaving diagnostics and vaccines "crooks." Americans today want reassurance and stability -- an advantage for Biden.

Viewers were also treated to the usual Sanders bromides on big banks and big oil. The far left's war with industrial and agricultural America that contributed to Trump's 2016 victory never ends in Sanders' world.

Biden appeared to drift at times toward positions held by Sanders. Caution to Biden: Millions of hard-working Americans pay their bills and repaid their student loans. Promising any form of free college will not endear them. "No new fracking" may placate the far left but is not a winning message in Biden's hometown of Scranton or western Pennsylvania.

Overall, Sanders attacked aggressively. He focused more on the past than the future. Biden came off as more presidential and spoke directly to the current emergency. Nothing tonight changed the trajectory of Biden's impending nomination. The only remaining question is when and how Sanders recognizes reality and bows out.

(CNN) The coronavirus relief package awaiting a Senate vote should not be delayed, and we must pass it immediately. But we need to do more.

The US is heading toward a recession, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi has already announced plans for an additional emergency response package. This is the right approach. We must act quickly to enact a major fiscal stimulus package that wards off economic disaster. This legislation must meet the challenge of the crisis we face by taking the next steps crucial to safeguarding our public health, including truly universal paid leave. And it must learn from the lessons of our response to the 2008 financial crash.

During 2008, I watched first-hand as our government offered a no-strings-attached bailout to the same giant banks that had driven our economy over a cliff. Meanwhile, the government did too little for most homeowners facing foreclosure. In the years that followed, the big banks quickly returned to profitability, while countless American families struggled to recover.

We can do better this time.

Next, the federal government should focus on recovery from the grassroots up, not Wall Street down. This means focusing on helping people directly, and, in doing so, addressing the gaping holes in our economy that leave families one lost paycheck away from defaulting on their mortgage, car, credit card or student loan payments.

Direct help begins by closing the gaps in the paid leave policies already approved by the House so that all workers have access to this critical benefit.

Direct help also means increasing Social Security benefits checks by $200 a month. That would send vital financial help to seniors and people with health conditions that make them more susceptible to Covid-19, while boosting the economy far more effectively than tax cuts.

A grassroots stimulus package should also include broad cancellation of student loan debt. The last economic crisis hit young people hard , plunging them deep into crushing student debt and pushing them into a historically weak job market. Temporarily suspending interest, as the President did last week , fails to right that generational wrong and only delays the pain for students. If the President won't act on his own, Congress should include student debt cancellation in a stimulus package.

Direct help to families also means confronting the short- and long-term costs of housing. No family should lose their home during a pandemic. Congress should immediately halt evictions in federally subsidized, backed or insured housing, institute a moratorium on all foreclosure proceedings, increase funding for homelessness services and create a new program to allow homeowners to delay or modify their mortgage payments during disasters. This is also the moment to invest in affordable housing construction and rehabilitation, which will stimulate the economy and create jobs in the short term, while lowering rents in the long term.

Any stimulus package must also pass an important test: federal money that goes to big corporations or specific industries must be used to help their employees. Funds must come with strings attached to ensure that the money goes to maintain payroll, not to enrich shareholders or pay executive bonuses. Giant corporations that receive substantial loans from taxpayers should be required to set aside one or more board seats for a representative elected by the company's workers. Violations should trigger criminal penalties and clawbacks.

(CNN) President Donald Trump has been rightly blasted for his combination of lies and incompetence when it comes to the handling of the coronavirus outbreak.

Two weeks ago he claimed that the threat posed by Covid-19 was the Democrats' new "hoax ." His administration also alarmingly delayed conducting widespread testing of Americans for the virus.

Now, the jaw-dropping images from numerous US airports on Saturday night mark yet another sorry milestone in Trump's failure to address this pandemic.

Words alone can't adequately describe the jarring scenes at airports in Chicago, Dallas, and New York, where people returning to the United States from European countries affected by coronavirus were forced to stand for hours at a time virtually on top of each other. These crowds come amid non-stop calls for social distancing from healthcare experts and even Trump himself

It resembled something from a horror movie or some dystopian universe. But it was not — it took place right here, in the United States.

What caused this pile-up of people? Simple: A lack of planning by Trump and his administration.

On Saturday night, the Trump administration's new "enhanced entry screenings" program went into effect to screen US citizens and permanent residents returning from Europe for the coronavirus. (Other travelers have mostly been barred from entering the country.)

Passengers must provide medical history and be checked for symptoms, such as a fever. During the 2014 Ebola outbreak, former President Barack Obama implemented a similar testing program for people arriving to the US from areas infected with the virus. (Trump in 2014 called Obama's Ebola airport testing program a "joke " despite no reports of people stuck on line for hours).

If there had been proper planning by the Trump administration, protocols could have been put in place to ensure a smooth functioning and health conscious way to effect this new policy. Instead, it was a sea of confusion that potentially resulted in more Americans contracting the virus.

Ann Lewis Schmidt, a passenger returning from Iceland, told CNN that after arriving at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport, passengers first waited in a line to have passports checked and then went on a second line to undergo medical screening.

It "seems backwards, as if someone had a fever, they should have been never allowed in these lines for four hours," Schmidt said, adding that passengers were in "very close quarters."

"So if we didn't have the virus before, we have a great chance of getting it now!"

Over at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York City, passengers said there was a shortage of government forms, no hand sanitizer and shared pens.

Alarmingly, at least three passengers screened at JFK on Saturday were sent to hospitals because of their symptoms, raising concerns about the virus being possibly spread to others who were trapped waiting on the long lines in tight quarters.

Potentially worse, another passenger, Kimberley Harris, told CNN that she saw passengers at the Dallas airport skipping the long medical testing line and just getting in lines where passengers didn't have to be screened, undermining the protection protocols.

"The crowds & lines O'Hare are unacceptable & need to be addressed immediately," he wrote. "These crowds are waiting to get through customs which is under federal jurisdiction."

The governor called on Trump and Vice President Mike Pence "to do something NOW."

Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, also tweeted his concerns.

"Admin was unprepared after Presidential ban on travel from Europe," he wrote.

In response to the backlash, Trump tweeted : "We are doing very precise Medical Screenings at our airports. Pardon the interruptions and delays, we are moving as quickly as possible, but it is very important that we be vigilant and careful. We must get it right. Safety first!"

Acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Mark Morgan issued a statement acknowledging that the "wait times experienced yesterday at some locations were unacceptable."

He said CBP "continually adjusts its resources as needed" and would continue to do so.

"With this national emergency, there will unfortunately be times of disruption and increased processing times for travelers. CBP is working around the clock to minimize these inconveniences."

The question, though, is why wasn't the Trump administration prepared to properly implement its own policy? It obviously understood that thousands of citizens and permanent residents would be returning to the United States. The administration should have set up a system that was efficient and effective, and should have ensured social distancing of people waiting for hours on line, instead of risking infecting healthy people.

The outbreak of an infectious disease, be it the coronavirus or Ebola which happened under Obama's watch, tests a president's leadership and ability to handle a crisis.

So far, Trump has failed that test. And worse, his administration's failure to prepare for its own "enhanced entry screening" program may actually result in infecting healthy Americans with the potentially deadly Covid-19. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
One is a high-achieving junior, the sort who runs, sings and does well academically. His brother, two minutes younger, is a sophomore who is a self-proclaimed nerd. He prefers to live on his computer in isolation, even when it's not actually mandatory.

In ordinary times, both are kind, gentle, smart kids, with whom I have a strong bond. A psychological educational evaluation found that the older twin has extraordinarily high self-sacrificing tendencies.

But that was before Covid-19.

In the past week, as each day New York State's restrictions on socializing have gotten tighter, my boys have become more shrill, more urgent and insistent about my "overreaction" to the social distancing guidelines.

Bear in mind, the elder just had his SAT exam and college tours canceled. Like high schoolers everywhere, both have had their spring semester canceled. Online classes have not started yet. They are supposed to be in Florida on spring break. And they are restless.

In a bitter irony of timing, the elder had just gotten himself a girlfriend. No matter how often I warned that he and his new girlfriend not meet, he slipped out -- and did just that. I repeatedly told him it's not my family that's so much at risk (my elderly mom and dad and family reside in the UK) but his girlfriend's relatives might be endangered if he is a virus carrier. He told me they kept six feet apart -- but I wonder how likely that is.

A few days ago, he went for a run in Central Park -- a run that went on for four hours. I asked what had kept him and he said he'd joined in a volleyball game -- exactly the sort New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said to avoid not 12 hours later.

He looked at me as if I was slightly dim when I squawked my disapproval.

My other son, the younger twin, atypically, decided this was the ideal week to break his habitual isolation. He turned his bedroom into a shelter for a not-very-good friend who was roaming New York City with a backpack and vast duffel bag in an act of rebellion against his divorcing parents. I was on a CNN conference call when this young man entered my home office and inquired if he could "explain" what was going on in his personal life, a prelude, I presumed, to asking if he could stay indefinitely.

Politely -- actually, not that politely -- I sent him home to his allegedly warring parents.

I'd just watched Gov. Cuomo say on TV that the new state guidelines forbade unnecessary people in our homes.

Thursday night, I pricked up my ears when psychologist Dr. Gretchen Schmelzer said on CNN's Town Hall that the group she was most concerned about under the new social distancing guidelines were teenagers.

"Teenagers are supposed to be leaving their homes and engaging with their peers and they're supposed to be trying new things," she told Anderson Cooper. "And they're to get less of that right now. And so they need to find ways to feel their impact and to stay connected to the groups that are important to them."

I phoned Dr. Schmelzer to get deeper insight into why she'd focused on teens. What she said was reassuring to me -- and, also, I suspect to other parents in a similar predicament. First, she said, teens in general just don't have the "capacity" or "maturity" to see outside their own selves right now.

"Teenagers are a group of people for whom risk has always been an issue," she said. "They weigh risk and this (Covid-19) doesn't seem that big. Historically we've capitalized on that by sending them to war, so the problem is they are now weighing in the mind the relative risk and it doesn't seem that big to them...Because in that kind of self-sovereign adult development state of life, it's about me...it's all about what I want."

Second, she said, teenage boys would be the single worst demographic to cope with Covid-19. Yes, worse than teenage girls. "They live in their bodies," she said. "If it doesn't feel dangerous -- (if) there's no physical sensation like standing on the edge of a bridge or doing something physically dangerous, they can't feel it...the idea that a grandmother might die is too abstract for them."

What then is a mother of teen boys to do?

"Stay in the fight," Schmelzer said. "Explain that this is for the health and safety (of the) country. That this a war like World War II was. Tell them stories about your grandparents' sacrifices in war time. Don't expect to get through in one conversation. Keep at it. Keep storytelling."

She suggested that discussions in military families might be different to those in families with no direct personal experience of war. "That's a segregation we haven't discussed," she pointed out.

And what should we do about our exes? Given the high US divorce rate , I'm not the only parent faced with the issue of how to best co-parent in a time that requires physical separation of households.

"Go for a walk with your ex-husband, six feet apart, and come up with a co-parenting program for the next four months" Schmelzer said. "I don't think cutting kids off from parents or giving people the ability to say 'Oh good I can cut my ex out now' is a good idea. "

I showed this article to my sons. Both acknowledged that Schmelzer had tapped into exactly how they were feeling. "People keep talking about an invisible enemy and it's really hard to understand that," said my younger son. "If you shipped me off to war, I'd feel useful. Now with the quarantine, I just feel helpless."

And the older? His girlfriend has now left New York City for the countryside. "I feel stuck and lonely," he said. But then he grinned, a heartening sign that he is growing into some perspective -- and maturity.

"You can write that I feel like Romeo, in 'Romeo and Juliet,'" he said. Then he laughed. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) Deserted streets. Empty stores and restaurants. Canceled birthday parties, weddings and graduation ceremonies. Hospitals bracing for a wave of patients needing care. At moments this week, it felt like we were living in a sci-fi novel -- and not a hopeful one.

But this wasn't Stephen King. It was reality in America — "social distancing" to slow the spread of the Covid-19 virus. And it may take weeks before we know how well it works.

King wrote a chilling fantasy about life in a post-pandemic world back in 1978, "The Stand." Earlier this month, he commented, reassuringly, on Twitter : "No, coronavirus is NOT like THE STAND. It's not anywhere near as serious. It's eminently survivable. Keep calm and take all reasonable precautions."

Still, the door-stopper of a book contains some wisdom that could guide us. One of its characters reflects, "Love didn't grow very well in a place where there was only fear, just as plants didn't grow very well in a place where it was always dark."

There is really no elsewhere, no place to retreat, no gated community whose walls will serve: We are all linked, and our health is a community function -- the well-being of others is also the well-being of ourselves ."

Annika Olson pleaded with her peers: "Sure, many of us can shake off the disease. But millions of people cannot, and we are putting their lives at risk. You touched the bartender you did not realize had diabetes, the waitress who has hypertension and is a single mom of two kids, or the cute guy who has no health insurance. Or, you visited your aging grandma, a friend recovering from a surgery, or your pregnant coworker. These people are all at serious risk of infection, losing their jobs, and losing their lives.

The population is far younger in South Korea and the disease is deadliest among older people, he wrote.

The hospital staff who risk their own health to treat Covid-19 patients are the greatest heroes in the unfolding story. Dr. Shan W. Liu, of Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, has a family connection to fighting illness: "More than a century ago, my great grandfather, Wu Lien Teh, vice director of China's Imperial Army Medical College, was tasked with controlling the pneumonic plague in northeastern China that killed nearly everyone it infected."

Liu wrote that social distancing is "difficult for everyone and potentially devastating to people who work in restaurants, airlines and many other industries. But since we don't have a vaccine to keep people from getting sick, public-health strategies are the only ones we have..."

"We in the emergency department will continue to come in at all hours, gown up and treat all who are sick. We ask you to do all you can to keep the virus contained. We all must do our part.

Trump: 'It's bad'

Gone was the man who had denied and downplayed for weeks. From the earliest days he had acted Americans looked to Washington for guidance and heard conflicting messages.

But would the President's newfound adherence to scientists last, Ghitis asked? "People like Dr. Anthony Fauci and Dr. Deborah Birx were trying to educate America. But their most important pupil was the President himself. Trump was an exasperating student, claiming to know as much as his teachers and propagating all manner of misinformation wrapped in self-aggrandizement. But eventually, he seemed to have got it."

AND:

The last time

Some Americans are old enough to remember the last time people were asked to make major sacrifices for the common good, as historian Meg Jacobs pointed out.

"This is not the first time that small, seemingly insignificant acts have taken on life or death meaning," she wrote. "Recycling a rusty screw, a bent nail, an old tire -- that might not seem like much. But during World War II that was everything. Thousands of miles away from the battlefield, Americans on the home front could help defeat the Nazis and save democracy if only they listened to their leaders and collected all their scrap metal. Together, piece by piece, towns could donate enough for a bullet or a gun or a tank."

There was more: "Repair a shirt rather than buy a new one, paint on nylons instead of wearing the real thing, go without cuffs on your pants; indeed, women wore pants instead of skirts since that used less fabric. Their bathing suits shrank. The fewer pairs of stockings worn by women, the more nylon available to use for parachutes."

And hoarding was frowned upon.

"Buy only your rationed share of sugar, don't spend extra money at the butcher to get a thicker cut of meat above your government-allotted allowance, make a peanut butter loaf instead of a meat loaf. Starting with Eleanor Roosevelt at the White House, 20 million women signed a pledge to purchase only their fair share and surrender their ration coupons." <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) Covid-19 is a pandemic of remarkable ferocity. The global population lacks immunity because this is the first time in known history that we are confronting this coronavirus. The virus is also highly transmissible.

To add to the problem, many people who have been infected experience mild, if any symptoms, and transmit the disease without awareness either of the infected individual or those who they are infecting. The consequences of infection are often severe : roughly 14% of cases require oxygen therapy and 5% require admission to an intensive care unit. A study by researchers at Imperial College London, which applied Chinese data to the UK, estimates the overall case fatality rate is around 0.9%

There are several phases to a pandemic. When there are still just a few cases, it is still possible to identify and isolate the infected individuals and trace the people they have come into contact with so they too can be either tested, monitored, and, if necessary, isolated. This is the so-called testing-and-tracing phase. A few places in East Asia -- notably Singapore, Hong Kong and Taiwan -- have so far succeeded in limiting the epidemic mainly to the testing-and-tracing phase.

When testing and tracing is lax, as it was in the US since January, the epidemic enters a second phase involving community spread and the exponential growth of cases. The rate of growth of the Covid-19 is extremely rapid, with a doubling time of five days or possibly less in an uncontrolled epidemic. A doubling rate of 5 days would mean 6 doublings in a month and 12 in two months, or roughly a 4,000-fold increase of infections over two months. The increase in infections, and deaths, would occur far more rapidly with an even shorter doubling time. The US is now in this explosive phase.

The key to limiting the epidemic in this breakout phase is some sort of shutdown in which all non-essential businesses are closed; events are canceled; public areas are cleared; and most people are ordered to remain in their homes. China implemented a stringent lockdown several weeks into the epidemic; Italy introduced its own measure last week. California, New York, and now many other states have issued "stay-at-home" orders asking people only to go out for activities like buying food. While President Donald Trump has so far dismissed talk of a nationwide lockdown policy, some experts consider it inevitable

A successful shutdown slows the rate of spread, and if carried out early enough and effectively enough, prevents the health care system from being utterly overwhelmed -- a terrifying prospect that could lead to the unnecessary deaths of countless thousands of Covid-19 patients, along with others who need immediate medical care. Moreover, it can ultimately bend the curve downward, dramatically reducing the number of those currently infected, as has been achieved in China

But any lockdown phase is extremely costly socially, politically and economically, and the goal is to lift it as soon as possible consistent with avoiding a rebound in the epidemic. The objective is to reduce the number of cases so that it becomes feasible to shift to a large-scale testing and tracing phase through a greatly amplified public health surveillance system. Longer-term solutions could involve new drugs and vaccines, and the gradual build-up over years or decades of herd immunity.

According to standard epidemiological models, an uncontrolled epidemic could infect 60% of the population, meaning around 200 million Americans. With a mortality rate on the order of 0.9 percent, that could mean 1-2 million deaths. The prospect is so utterly horrendous that every effort must be made to break the transmission through a lockdown.

The US is still in the disastrous breakout phase, as a result of the shocking incompetence of Trump and his administration. Trump failed to take this pandemic seriously at the start and bloviated his way through the first phase of the epidemic when the newly introduced virus was still potentially controllable through testing, tracing and associated public health management. His narcissism, incompetence, and dithering have gravely endangered the nation. There will be time enough to dispense political justice to Trump. Now we must act to save our country.

Most urgently, the US must now lock down much of our national economic and social activity in order to slow and then substantially break virus transmission. National output will plummet during April through June, by perhaps more than 20 percent

Never before has our national policy been the deliberate closure of much of the economy, but that is what we need now for survival. We must keep functioning the essential parts of the economy (most government services, healthcare, the food supply chain, social support, infrastructure, urgent maintenance) and online services (finance, media, professional services, e-commerce). Some work tasks (thank goodness, farming among them) are also relatively safe as they do not involve close interpersonal contacts that can transmit the virus.

In the shutdown phase, we must give special protection to the older population (60+), and the population with prior conditions (e.g. heart, lung, and metabolic disorders). Those 60+ account for 80% of the deaths. The elderly will need special social support to stay healthy in isolation. We must also support society to grapple with the mental and physical dangers of prolonged isolation. Additionally, we must provide urgent income support, especially unemployment compensation and help for the indigent and low-income families.

Another obvious need is to ensure there are enough ventilators, hospital beds, and protective gear for health care professionals to meet the surge in patients in the coming weeks. It is unconscionable and unacceptable for nurses, doctors, and orderlies to be fighting on the front lines without face masks and other critical gear. There is no time to lose.

During the shutdown phase, we must build up the capacity of our health system to test and trace the disease. This capacity is currently missing, in no small part because of the incompetence of the Trump administration. Once this period reduces the prevalence of the infection, we will want to shift as soon as possible to testing and tracing, thereby giving the opportunity to lift the closures step by step. In essence we will move from a generalized and costly lockdown to more focused public health control of the epidemic. This will only be possible with two conditions: substantial reduction of incidence of new infections and a greatly enlarged capacity for testing, tracing, and isolating infected individuals. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) As people who have worked to respond to the HIV pandemic for most of our adult lives — one of us as an HIV activist and the other as an epidemiologist — we understand the consequences of early mistakes in the response to disease outbreaks and how politicians can often stand in the way of protecting the public's health.

We offer a few insights from our vantage point in the hopes of influencing the response to the current coronavirus pandemic, as well as future public health emergencies. The time is now, just as it was in the early phase of the AIDS epidemic, for ordinary citizens to organize, act up and demand that their government work to save their lives.

In a vacuum of information, most politicians will act to preserve the status quo. A prerequisite to an effective early response to any outbreak is having "epidemic intelligence" — adequate data on spread that can serve as an accurate, early guide for the public health response and rapidly inform any necessary course corrections.

It is not possible to "fight a fire blindfolded," according to World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who emphasized the need for widespread testing to fight the pandemic. After weeks of limited testing, the number of confirmed cases in the US has surpassed 23,000 people with the actual number almost guaranteed to be much higher. The federal government's botched testing rollout could turn out to be one of the great public health failures of modern times, having blinded the US public health response at a critical juncture.

The lack of testing led to a vacuum of epidemic intelligence, creating a false sense of security among the American public while the Trump administration continued to spread misinformation. By the time the cases of community spread came to light in California, Washington and New York , widespread transmission had already occurred.

Theresa Brown is a clinical faculty member at the University of Pittsburgh and author of "The Shift: One Nurse, Twelve Hours, Four Patients' Lives." The views expressed here are hers. Read more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) Last week, I returned to the US from a family vacation in Spain, and am now completing 14 days of self-isolation, as required by my employer, the University of Pittsburgh. When these 14 days are up, I want to go back to bedside nursing and join the frontlines in fighting the coronavirus pandemic.

But when I raised the issue with my family, my 21-year-old daughter cautioned, "Don't do it if there isn't protective equipment."

One might imagine such sage advice is unnecessary in one of the richest countries in the world, but alas, my daughter captured the essence of a frightening problem: Severe shortages of masks and personal protective equipment (PPE) for nurses, doctors, and other health care workers.

I first learned about the seriousness of the mask shortages from Twitter, where nurses shared the disturbing CDC guidance for health care providers (HCP) to use scarves or bandanas as a last resort if medically approved masks are not available.

The more efficient N95 respirator masks, which filter out 95% of airborne particles, are in short supply. If N95 masks are limited and surgical masks are not available as backup, the CDC advises that "it may be necessary for HCP to use masks that have never been evaluated or approved by NIOSH or homemade masks," adding the ominous warning that "caution should be exercised when considering this option." In Georgia, at least one hospital has already started sewing homemade mask coverings out of surgical sheeting to extend the life of N95s.

President Donald Trump has not expressed an appropriate sense of urgency about getting American health care workers the supplies they need. Earlier this week, he punted the responsibility to governors, saying , "The federal government is not supposed to be out there buying vast amounts of items, and then shipping. We're not a shipping clerk."

And while Vice President Mike Pence said 35 million medical masks were available to hospitals after an increase in production by Honeywell and 3M, health care professionals across the country remained uncertain when hospitals would see those supplies. Dr. Megan Ranney appeared on CNN and said , "The President may say that things are being produced, but they sure as heck are not showing up in my state or in the state of all my colleagues across the country. We need those masks and gowns now."

The current administration's sluggish response to the pandemic has put an enormous pressure on our health system. The resulting surge in coronavirus cases has led to unnecessary shortages and growing panic. We still aren't up to speed when it comes to testing large numbers of people, we still don't have enough ventilators to handle the patient load if the number of people who are infected continues to increase, and we still don't have even close to the amount of masks and PPE needed to keep medical professionals safe.

The general public needs to understand the importance of protecting health care professionals amid the Covid-19 pandemic; If they fall ill, who will be left to treat the sick? We are attempting to limit the spread of the disease through social distancing and self-isolation. But the infection rate and severity of Covid-19 cases in other countries suggest that the sickest patients will need intensive care and long-term respiratory support to even have a chance at surviving. This could easily overwhelm our health care system.

If this happens, and a significant number of health care professionals are infected due to a lack of masks or other protective equipment, patients with Covid-19, not to mention heart attack patients, trauma victims from car crashes, or those newly diagnosed with cancer — just to name a few — will not be able to receive the care they need. I hate to say this, but if our medical workforce is depleted, many more people will die from Covid-19 and other serious health issues than would have otherwise.

I am surprised at the Trump administration's apathetic response to this shortage, but my re-entry into the US after being in Spain gave me a taste of just how little the administration seems to understand what all of us are up against. When we landed at John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York last weekend, all the passengers were herded together, along with others flying in from Europe, and seated in an unventilated room for an hour. We had our temperatures taken before we were sent on our way with a postcard telling us what to do if we became ill (call your provider; do not automatically go to the emergency room, it read).

It was a mess, but the amateurish response was not nearly as troubling as the lack of concern from the US Customs agents I encountered. We overheard agents saying, "Everyone has a different idea of what's going on," and "There were only three flights for them to check and they missed a whole f**king flight." They gave us paper forms to fill out that looked like they had been photocopied from dot-matrix printers from two decades ago, and they didn't even have enough for the 50 or so people in the room. None of the customs agents seemed to take the "enhanced screening" seriously. Fundamentally, no one seemed to care — at least not nearly enough.

The level of incompetence, combined with indifference, scared me. If the government had so poorly planned for the return of thousands of Americans due to travel restrictions the government itself put in place, what would that mean for its ability to confront other challenges during the pandemic? What we saw at JFK seemed like a harbinger of worse things to come, like the shortage of masks and PPE.

I still want to return to the bedside when my 14 days of self-isolation are up. But will I be able to do that with all possible assurances of safety? On Wednesday, President Trump invoked the Defense Production Act, which would allow him to direct manufacturers to produce much-needed medical equipment. But hours after he signed the measure, he waffled and tweeted that he would only use it in a "worst case scenario." On Friday, Trump claimed the measure had kicked into "high gear," although he failed to clearly convey what that would mean

Meanwhile, health care providers have taken to social media for help, but that is no way to fight a pandemic. Nurses and doctors are the frontline soldiers in this war against the coronavirus. For medical professionals to do their jobs and effectively care for others, the government must make it possible for us to safeguard ourselves. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) Public health officials tell us to minimize physical contact in order to combat the Covid-19 pandemic. While the public, thankfully, is hearing the message, there is a hidden danger: As we retreat into our homes, we can lose sight of our essential connections to one another and forget about the plight of those most vulnerable to the fraying of social bonds.

It is important for us all to realize that when they recommend "social distancing" -- a phrase that has rapidly entered the public lexicon -- what health experts are really promoting are practices that temporarily increase our physical distance from one another in order to slow the spread of the virus.

They are not recommending social disconnection, social exclusion, or rampant individualism.

To combat those social ills, we should replace the term "social distancing" with the more precise "physical distancing." In fact, when we practice physical distancing, we need social connectivity and social responsibility more than ever.

On Friday, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced strict new measures for isolation (as California's Gov. Gavin Newsom did the day before). In his televised remarks, Cuomo noted the difficulty -- but crucial necessity -- of maintaining physical distance from loved ones.

But even as he rolled out these drastic measures (including civil penalties) to ensure physical distance, he underscored the importance of maintaining social connections , touchingly recounting how he is doing this himself with his daughter, who was in isolation for two weeks.

"I was very aware of what she was dealing with and what she was feeling," he said. "I tell you the truth I had some of the best conversations with her that I have ever had ... we talked about things in depth that we didn't have time to talk about in the past, or we didn't have the courage or the strength to talk about in the past." He urged people to be "mindful" that those "three word sentences can make all the difference: 'I miss you;' you know 'I love you, I'm thinking about you; I wish I was there with you; I'm sorry you're going through this'..."

In the difficult circumstances we are facing now, we can still connect and take social responsibility -- even as we are trying to stay physically distant. Social responsibility and connectivity come in different forms, and they go hand in hand with empathy, compassion, and humanity.

So how do we remain socially connected and responsibly engaged at a time when physical distance is critical?

For one, we can use technology to strengthen friendships and support one another through telephone, social media, text, video chat, and even gaming. If you are able to work from home, consider taking the time you would have spent commuting to reach out to family, friends, and neighbors -- even and especially those who might not have heard from you in a while.

Now is the time to unleash our capacity for collective creativity and find new ways to build meaningful community and connection.

We can also turn our creative energies toward social action. Seattle, which has been hit hard by the pandemic, is witnessing an impressive flourishing of outreach: people helping each other out. One Seattle resident -- an artist -- made a Facebook live video where he read guidance from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to the Ethiopian-American community -- in Amharic -- in order to replace swirling rumor and misinformation with hard science.

Even the writing of this piece has been a group effort -- by UCLA sociologists concerned that the call for "social distancing" risked doing unintentional harm -- and needed to be replaced with the more precise language of "physical distancing."

Physical (but not social) distancing still allows us to provide material support to the most vulnerable in many ways, like asking neighbors if we can pick up groceries, pet food, and other essentials for them -- delivered from a safe distance -- to minimize travel. We can refrain from panic shopping and the hoarding of essential resources, which creates artificial scarcity that affects everyone.

We can organize to provide enrichment for youngsters who are suddenly being homeschooled, as in the #openschools project. We can combat the spread of misinformation online and enhance the collective intelligence of social media discourse about Covid-19. And we can call on our leaders, employers, and corporations to provide needed resources and coverage for people who cannot afford to work from home so that they too can practice physical distancing.

In California, the most populous state in the country, Gov. Newsom has ordered residents to stay home and closed restaurants, bars, gyms, retail stores, offices, and all non-essential establishments to ensure physical distancing.

We must be particularly supportive of those among us who are vulnerable to contagion -- unable to "physically distance"-- precisely because of the work they do . This includes not only health care workers but also service and delivery workers, domestic and home care workers, cashiers, sanitation workers, janitors, store clerks, farm workers, and food servers who quietly but vitally sustain our collective lifestyles, even in a pandemic.

They cannot afford to be absent from work, cannot work remotely, and often do not have health insurance.

In large cities, like our own Los Angeles, these workers are often immigrants who also bear the weight of negative stereotypes and discrimination and often experience social and institutional exclusion. Our notions of social connection and responsibility must be big enough to include the vulnerable among us. As coronavirus has made abundantly clear, health is not an individual matter. Such diseases do not respect social or political divisions.

While the Covid-19 pandemic will eventually pass, its consequences will be with us for years. The fallout will disproportionately harm many of the same people who are suffering now: the socially and economically marginalized. But this is not inevitable.

Just as physical distancing can give us a fighting chance of combating this virus, finding creative and socially responsible ways to connect in crisis can have positive and long-lasting effects on our communities.

We must be physically distant now -- our health depends on it. But we should redouble our efforts to be socially close. Our health depends on that, too. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) As of midday Thursday, the US was preparing for the coronavirus pandemic to last up to 18 months. Germany is mobilizing its army and more than 60 million people in Italy are under lockdown i n a bid to stem the spread of the disease. For weeks, social media, rolling news coverage and email inboxes have been saturated with updates, as global populations try to keep pace with a story which evolves by the hour.

A few people, however, have been totally unaware of the scale of the catastrophe until recent days.

They are the "Big Brother" housemates in Germany, Brazil and Canada, all of whom went into a news blackout when they entered their respective houses weeks ago. The CBS reality show sees more than a dozen strangers live in a house fitted up with cameras filming their every move for weeks, and broadcasting their most "dramatic" moments for the TV audience.

The participants' ignorance in the face of the escalating crisis presents an ethical dilemma which heightens the already murky quandaries around reality television. The situation has amplified the vulnerabilities of the "Big Brother" housemates, who have, by the nature of the show, been unable to make a timely choice about how to respond to coronavirus.

Normal " Big Brother" rules stipulate that participants are only informed of happenings in the outside world in the event of a family death or illness -- otherwise they are cut off from the world, without phone or internet access. Producers for the show have adhered to that rule even as coronavirus has closed borders and set the world in turmoil.

But on Tuesday night, producers of the German show reversed their previous decision not to say anything, and told housemates to gather in the living room for a debrief from the presenter about the current state of the coronavirus in a live show.

The housemates were sent reassuring video messages from smiling family members. They also had the opportunity to ask a doctor questions. All decided to stay in the house. In Canada, where the housemates were told the news over the weekend, off-camera via the PA system , the housemates made the same decision.

There is some precedent for this kind of crisis management on Big Brother. In 2001, the final three contestants of "Big Brother 2" in the US were told about the September 11 attacks on the day. This exception to contestants' complete isolation from outside reality was made because one participant had a cousin who was missing, and the trio were only told the barest details. All decided to remain in the house, which did not have a TV or internet access. They didn't learn the full extent of the world-altering tragedy until September 20.

Though a different news scenario, the circumstance then posed a similar problem to that of the coronavirus news. When an event is so gigantic and all-consuming, and updates come thick and fast, it is impossible to appreciate the full implications unless you are out in the world, seeing and experiencing it.

Without being immersed in the same 24-hour news coverage, in constant contact with friends and relatives whose situations might change at any minute, how can the current "Big Brother" contestants truly make an informed decision about whether to stay in the house or leave?

The answer is they can't. And while the contestants might have made the choice to leave and isolate with their families if they'd been aware of the gravity of the situation sooner, that is an option which could be swept away from them at any time. Nearly 3,000 new coronavirus cases were confirmed in Germany between Wednesday and Thursday, with Chancellor Angela Merkel on Wednesday evening calling Covid-19 the "greatest postwar challenge" the country has faced.

Should a family member develop symptoms of Covid-19, a 'Big Brother' housemate will not be able to return to them once they leave the Big Brother house without risk of infection. With travel restrictions, health advice and the scale of the response evolving around the world day by day, there can be no guarantee that it will be possible for contestants to weather the rest of what might be a monthslong pandemic with their loved ones.

While this is of course also the case for many others missing weddings, older relatives and having trouble returning to their home countries, in most cases the news of the developing situation will have been available to them. It is a measure of the inhumanity of the situation in the "Big Brother" house that it has been compared in news coverage to the dystopian 2008 British Drama "Dead Set," which depicted British Big Brother housemates blissfully unaware of a zombie apocalypse.

One could argue that there are probably fewer places in the world safer than the Big Brother houses. They are effectively ready-made isolation centers. (Four new participants who entered the German "Big Brother" house on 9 March were assessed by a doctor, and declared symptom-free. However when they leave the house, the inmates will immediately have to adjust to a new way of life -- one completely at odds with what they've been used to for weeks.

Building new habits -- like constant hand-washing, not touching faces, keeping distant from people and sanitizing after touching anything outside, will take time. Having acclimatized to a "Big Brother" environment deliberately set up to maximize social mixing, sharing, and all interactions, this could prove jarring. Any lag in snapping into gear -- like thoughtlessly touching their mouths while traveling -- could put them in danger of infection, and hence in danger of infecting others.

In this instance, the practical implications of the housemates being kept so long in the dark might outweigh even the moral wretchedness of the show's producers parlaying a global disaster into a TV stunt. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) Covid-19 is poised to become an extinction-level event for America's nonprofits. Cultural institutions have been forced to close their doors. Organizations working in and around public schools or in senior centers cannot provide services because their clients are not showing up.

Fundraising events have been canceled. Many essential front-line social services -- e.g., operating homeless shelters -- cannot be delivered remotely and pose particular risks of infection, increasing the costs of keeping staff safe.

Unless government, funders and nonprofit leaders take immediate and decisive action, many nonprofits around the nation may just disappear over the next few months leaving those they serve and employ in disastrous circumstances.

Although the federal government and the press are focused on the plight of the big industries -- airlines, hotels, cruise ships -- nonprofits employ more people than many of these industries. Furthermore, nonprofits typically don't have the cash, credit lines assets (e.g. ships, planes, landing rights, brand names) or lobbyists that guarantee the survival of these industries in one shape or another.

Most nonprofits are purpose-driven, small businesses "owned" by the public. Their survival is arguably even more important than that of similar for-profit businesses because they work with, and often employ, the most vulnerable people. It's important that any relief for small business includes nonprofit small business as well.

The truth is that our capitalist system will likely quickly rebuild the for-profit ecosystem after the Covid-19 crisis has passed. Planes will fly. Cruise ships will sail. New restaurants will emerge to take the place of those that failed, buying the fixed assets at a discount, occupying the same storefronts at lower rents and serving the same clientele.

Unfortunately, nonprofits that fail cannot be so easily replaced or restarted. Few have the type of hard, tangible assets that can survive a gap in service. There is no all-powerful profit-motive to fuel a reconstruction. Philanthropy is not good at providing front-loaded, restart capital at scale.

While the nonprofit sector is often taken for granted, it provides much of what is most valuable in social service, arts and culture, recreation and education. For example, the countless nonprofits delivering human services represent a $200 billion industry that touches the lives of more than 1 in 5 Americans, including: housing more than 200,000 elderly Americans, providing homes to 670,00 foster children and serving food to 46 million people through food banks.

Just how bad could it be? Our earlier analysis of nonprofits suggests that less than half of nonprofits have one month of operating reserves and less than six months of cash to keep them running. Without outside help, the trajectory of demise for many nonprofits is clear: the executive directors and boards delay taking tough restructuring actions; the organizations have to stiff their vendors, then furlough or lay off staff; the founders stop paying themselves; and finally, they shut down when the bank account is dry and payroll can't be made.

The failure of Federation Employment & Guidance Service (FEGS) in 2015, then New York City's largest social service agency, should remind us how damaging it can be when a big nonprofit fails, leaving vulnerable people—the home-bound, the developmentally disabled, the homeless, foster-children—without services.

Fortunately, FEGS failed for idiosyncratic, self-inflicted reasons and was surrounded by healthy groups -- like the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services -- who were able to pick up the pieces

In the current environment, this is unlikely to happen. More likely, the failure of a single large organization will have a cascading impact on the local social service system.

Many social service nonprofits with budgets of $50 million or more are overwhelmingly reliant on government funding.

They are, in effect, extensions of city and state government. Each of these large, groups should be deemed a Systemically Important Nonprofit Institution (a "SINI"), and state and local government should be in continuous contact with each of them just as the federal government is with Systemically Important Financial Institutions it deems "too big to fail."

In the face of this looming disaster, we all have work to do:

Nonprofit leaders and boards: Be tough-minded. Nonprofits must go into cash-conservation mode. It is hard to stiff vendors, lay people off, furlough or reduce pay or take advantage of eviction-stays to simply not pay the rent. But a tough restructuring allowing for survival and the continuation of the mission (which is a nonprofit's sole reason for being) is far better than hitting the wall and closing up shop altogether. Nonprofits should also explore mergers, consolidations and the divestment of "non-core" programs, though the number of "takers" is probably small in the midst of a crisis. They must learn to play "hard ball" and remember that a nonprofit cannot be involuntarily put into bankruptcy by its creditors. If hitting the wall is inevitable, leaders must resist magical thinking and plan for a sensible dissolution that aims to preserve and transition services for those in need. Making the best of a terrible situation may be the only thing leaders can do.

Foundations: Step up and be creative. Foundations should boost their support now to keep nonprofits in business and then, if necessary, cut their spending in future years once these organizations are back on their feet. The only thing that prevents foundations from giving more now is their desire not to privilege the present over the future. But at this moment the present needs privileging.

Silicon Valley, Philadelphia, It is heartening that in Seattle New York and other cities, philanthropic leaders are actively exploring (or have already created) collaborative rapid response funds. These funds need to be able to make fast decisions and should offer loans, grants and guarantees. They should support nonprofits, underlying individuals (both clients and staff), restructurings and even managed dissolutions.

Rich people: If not now, when? Despite the paper losses in their portfolios due to the crisis, the 1% have never been more (relatively) privileged than they are right now. They can work from their second homes, can meet monthly expenses, and some—like distressed investors—may even profit from the carnage.

They should front-load their giving by paying for next year's theatre season this year, giving as if they had attended a canceled gala, accelerating multi-year pledges, and more. Those who had been planning to be more philanthropic in the future —for example, the Giving Pledgers who have yet to give much—must ask themselves "If not now, when?"

Government: Be a good partner. Nonprofits that cannot do the work through no fault of their own should still be paid (teachers are paid if school is closed). Government agencies should waive normal procurement procedures to get contracts registered and bills paid on an accelerated basis. They should defer the recoupment of advances. They should ease performance-based payment requirements. They should recognize that protecting the Systemically Important Nonprofit Institutions will be less costly—in financial and human terms—than letting them fail and scrambling to pick-up the pieces. Initiatives to provide zero-interest loans and employee-retention grants to support small businesses should be extended to include nonprofits.

Even if we do all this, many nonprofits will still disappear. Some will likely close their doors in the next six months, more over the next two years. Work that has been going on for decades or longer may vanish. But hopefully the passion and people once invested in these organizations will, after we get through this mess, find its way back into the sector. We can't afford to lose these precious resources. The work of nonprofits and the passion of their people will be more important than ever as we rebuild the post-Covid-19 world. Part of that rebuilding must include putting in place the systems to ensure that we are better prepared next time. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) The second week of March, performance artist Tim Miller was leading a solo performance workshop at the University of Minnesota. Six and a half hours before their final showcase, scheduled for 7:30 p.m. on Friday, March 13, the governor declared a state of " peacetime emergency ."

Four and a half hours before the showcase, the president of the university announced a case of coronavirus within the campus community. Four hours before the showcase, the chair of the theater department canceled it.

Though the performers hadn't known it, the rehearsal the night before had been their last time together in one room. Professor Sonja Kuftinec told me in an email that their private, final gathering had begun with her, "like a workshop priestess," leading the artists in a "Purell ritual," and that "among other performances that evening, an older undergraduate, an HIV-positive 61-year-old-student, shared his journey of living through an earlier plague."

The world is living through an epidemic and people are dying -- finding a way to stem that suffering has to be the primary focus. But as the economic carnage from coronavirus grows apace and social distancing becomes a way of life, the widespread cancellation of performances -- with no end in sight -- has left many thousands of actors, stage managers, musicians and others struggling to find ways to survive, to put food on the table and a roof over their heads.

Even in the face of such deep economic precarity, many of these performers are finding ways to share their art with the world and support each other while doing it.

Paula Vogel, playwright of the 1998 Pulitzer Prize for Drama winner "How I Learned to Drive," has waited 23 years for the play to make it to Broadway; it was set to open April 22 at the Manhattan Theatre Club with its original co-stars, Mary Louise Parker and David Morse.

With Broadway dark until at least April 13, the future of the production is uncertain, yet Vogel said in an email to me, "Not seeing everyone else's show is harder for me than not bringing 'How I Learned to Drive' to fruition. Yes, we've been waiting 23 years to cross over from Off-Broadway to Broadway; but I know the ending of my own shows. It's not seeing the house lights dim and rise from the many playwrights who offer me my spiritual daily bread."

It's unsurprising that an artist as generous as Vogel would focus on other playwrights and their losses; I'm heartbroken, however, about "How I Learned to Drive." I had planned to see it on April 11, having set a calendar alert for the instant tickets went on sale and booked airfare from Oregon to New York, all so I could experience my favorite play in performance with its original cast -- a play I teach ever semester, a play I hope to direct sometime in my life. There's much to mourn for artists, but not being able to see this specific production has hit me the hardest.

Like many communities, those who make their living through the performing arts are suffering in the wake of coronavirus quarantines and physical distancing.

In times of extreme precarity, artists tend to bond together: 48 hours after the 9/11 attacks, all 23 Broadway theaters were open as performers sought to give solace to a grieving city; on the eve of the 2003 US invasion of Iraq, artists around the world offered simultaneous performances of Aristophanes' peace play "Lysistrata."

Forced isolation threatens to strip artists of the communities in which they thrive and to leave cities and towns across the country bereft of the culture that feeds the soul. Musicians, performance artists, playwrights and actors are forging new ways to offer artistic, emotional and material support to one another.

That private sharing at the University of Minnesota might have been one of the last examples of live artistic communion in the country for the foreseeable future, before, out of necessity, performers began turning to digital platforms to express their solidarity and practice their art.

The Seattle Symphony, from one of the localities in America hardest hit by the virus, has been at the forefront, with live streams and rebroadcasts expanding the connections the orchestra shares with its audience.

On Thursday March 12, they streamed a September 2019 performance of Mahler's Symphony No. 1; Krishna Thiagarajan, president and CEO for the Seattle Symphony, shared with me in an email that "there were thousands of people tuning in together, at the same time, all around the world to experience this music. It was a virtual event that 130,000 thousand people experienced, and you could feel the same sense of community through the comments and engagement during the concert."

In addition to airing previously recorded concerts, the organization is exploring livestreaming solo performances happening in real time, on a volunteer basis, alongside family friendly livestreams with an educational angle in which an individual musician might offer a lesson or talk viewers through the parts of their instrument.

As a theater professor in the Pacific Northwest, I'm grappling with lost artistic opportunities.

Portland Center Stage at The Armory was meant to produce Heather Raffo's one-woman play "9 Parts of Desire," a visceral piece about nine Iraqi women surviving war and sanctions. I had been scheduled to lead a preshow discussion and a workshop as part of the run of this show; the theater has canceled all events until after April 14, which is disappointing to me professionally, but more importantly, it's a cultural loss to the Portland community. The piece offers profound insights into the effects of almost three decades of disastrous US policy in Iraq.

Other performing arts organizations, such as the Metropolitan Opera and Austin's annual South by Southwest ( SXSW ) film and music festival (whose annual gathering was one of the first major arts events in the US canceled because of the virus), are following the Seattle Symphony's lead, embracing widely accessible free streaming, releasing new content or opening up back catalogues. CNN.com has organized a handy list of many such events here

Sean Cercone, president and CEO of Broadway Licensing, which licenses rights to perform copyrighted scripts, foresaw the massive theater closures not just on Broadway, but across the country.

In a phone interview with me, Cercone described how company got to work early convincing playwrights to release special livestreaming rights of productions of their plays that had been in rehearsals and were ready for an audience, including those at elementary and high schools.

These special licenses are for fully streamed events, not recordings -- there's no archival video, and the event is a virtual attempt to replicate the the live experience of being present in an actual theater. Audiences for these events can enact typical preshow rituals such as drinks or dinner (in their own domestic spaces), tune in at the top of the livestream, and when the event is over, the link disappears.

Cercone shared with me that this past weekend, elementary students at Trevor Day School in New York livestreamed their performance of "The Old Man and the Old Moon," wanting to keep their grandparents safe yet still share their hard work.

It's worth noting, however, that these types of events require the cast to come together in a single space, often in close proximity with each other, to perform in real time -- itself a risk. Cercone said that so far, no organization or school requesting these streaming rights has canceled, but he believes it's only a matter of time.

Not every theatrical production has access to livestream rights, and many organizations are outright canceling productions, sending artists home to increase physical distancing. These cancellations will hit early-career playwrights especially hard, so award-winning playwrights Stephanie Alison Walker and Donna Hoke launched an initiative on Facebook for artists to review the written scripts of new plays with canceled productions. In lieu of performance reviews, these script reviews can give playwrights the visibility boost they need to grow their careers.

When I asked her about the long-term effects of canceling productions, playwright Leanna Keyes told me, "It's easy to imagine that the next theater season will have a lot more 'safe shows' and a lot fewer new plays, which most people consider to be riskier. There will always be hunger for new and exciting work, so these plays will find a home eventually, but it's difficult to predict what impact these unprecedented circumstances will have on the current generation of emerging playwrights."

Productions of Keyes' plays across the country have been postponed or canceled, with one summer production still up in the air.

With colleges -- including mine -- postponing productions until next season and moving courses online, virtual performing arts education presents new challenges for professors and students alike.

For the rest of this semester, I'll be teaching my seminar "The History of the Broadway Musical" online, and I'm relieved that we did our Fosse unit before this transition; learning the choreography for "All That Jazz" would have been more challenging on Zoom than in person. The students in the course have voted for synchronous learning -- I think for some, having a chance to gather in a place with their classmates, even if that place is a virtual classroom, presents a sense of normalcy and community that we all need right now.

Back in 1984, along with a few other New York-based playwrights, Vogel created " The Great American Play Bake-Off " in which a writer is given a formula and 48-hours to write a play. She emailed me her Bake-off prompt for this pandemic, which instructs writers to craft a play involving: "A fishmonger in a market place in Wuhong, A couple running a cafe in Tehran, An opera singer in Milan, A writer in solitude in (wherever you are writing this Bake-off), (extra credit: Donald Trump in quarantine in the White House), cotton swabs and a soliloquy from a pangolin."

Students at the University of Minnesota are following Vogel's lead, posting prompts for their own quarantine Bake-off with plans to read the best 10 play submissions on YouTube; according to the student newspaper, over 2,100 people worldwide plan to participate.

Personally, I've taken the premise of a Bake-off and am using it as a lesson plan for homeschooling my kids; yesterday, I gave them a prompt and an hour, and they wrote and illustrated short stories. I may have lost my opportunity to see Vogel's play, but she's still influencing my teaching.

With quarantines likely to increase and so many suffering, have heart that artists are taking the lead in holding each other and their communities, even while in isolation. During the age of coronavirus, the show must go on(line). <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) For the past 10 months I had been planning my father's eulogy. I was rehearsing lines in my head, jotting down ideas when they came to me, trying to perfect it, so it would be just right for when the moment came. But in a cruel twist of events I was forced to write a eulogy for my mother with less than 24 hours' notice.

It was my dad who was dying of brain cancer, but it was my mom who was now dead. And as the country was shutting down and canceling events because of coronavirus, I was now planning a funeral.

David Gelles

I always imagined my mom's funeral would be when she was in her late 90s. After all, my grandmother lived until she was 97 -- and pretty much outlived every one of her friends. She had good genes, everyone in the family had said.

My mother was just 75, younger than some presidential candidates, and still had dozens of friends who wanted to attend her funeral. But Saturday, in the hours after she died, hours after I watched her take her last breath, I was furiously texting her friends and saying, please don't come to her funeral.

The synagogue was closed. The funeral home was closed, and we could do only a graveside service. On top of everything, my father was in failing health and social distancing was an imperative.

(CNN) I am a 25-year-old healthy runner. And, until further notice, I will be running in isolated areas, reading books, baking and doing yoga at home.

But for most of you, it feels like spring break is in full force. Every day, I see more and more Instagram stories of young people at concerts and boozy brunches than I care to count.

Recently, Katie Williams, a former Ms. Nevada and candidate for the Clark County School Board of Trustees in Las Vegas, tweeted proudly about her trip to a crowded Red Robin in response to Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez urging "healthy people & people under 40 [to] PLEASE stop crowding bars, restaurants, and public spaces right now. Eat your meals at home."

On Tuesday, some Florida beaches were crowded with young folks swimming and sunbathing, despite federal social distancing guidelines. And airlines dramatically reduced capacity and the federal government contemplated canceling domestic flights . There's even some reporting to indicate that some young people see an opportunity for travel deals -- unconscionable, given that experts say we should all act as if we have the virus. This kind of frivolous movement by people who think they're healthy shows a callous disregard not just for those who are medically vulnerable but for our very health-care system itself.

As a generation, we have tackled issues like climate change , which unfolds over decades and millennia. Why are some of us unable to look two weeks into the future here?

You've all seen the numbers about Covid-19. What you may not realize is that these numbers are not just lower than in reality, but -- given our relative lack of testing and the fact that you can be contagious even if you don't feel sick -- they are likely exponentially lower.

When something increases exponentially, it doubles or triples at each step, so that something that looks moderate suddenly becomes extreme. The average person with Covid-19 transmits it to somewhere between two and three people, and, without adequate testing, we have to assume it's been circulating for a while.

Imagine spending a day at the beach. Let's say one -- just one -- person had the novel coronavirus and gave it to just two other people. If those three people each pass it to two more people, then those nine people each pass it to two other people, then you have 27 people infected on day three. That means at the end of one week 2,187 people would have Covid-19.

Here's the kicker: many of those people won't even know they are sick. You may be contagious even if you have no symptoms (and it can take nearly two weeks for symptoms to develop). Some young people who contract Covid-19 may never get physically sick -- but they can still pass it to many others who will.

In fact, data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicates that though the most severe outcomes are happening among older people, millennials are not immune. An estimated 29% of the coronavirus cases where the age of the patient is known falls in the 20- to 44-year-old range.

So sure, many of us can shake off the disease. But millions of people cannot, and we are putting their lives at risk. You touched the bartender you did not realize had diabetes, the waitress who has hypertension and is a single mom of two kids, or the cute guy who has no health insurance.

Or, you visited your aging grandma, a friend recovering from a surgery, or your pregnant coworker. These people are all at serious risk of infection, losing their jobs, and losing their lives. The viruses we carry in our bodies right now might be the ones that end theirs.

With the disease replicating in the US as quickly as it is in Italy, in two weeks we could be where they are now. Italian journalist Mattia Ferraresi recently admitted , "many of us were too selfish to change our behavior. Now we're in lockdown and people are needlessly dying." Let's not let the crisis in Italy be in vain; let's learn from it.

We have shown that we have the leadership skills, social media savviness and commitment to our friends, family, and community to push for major paradigm shifts. This time, we do that by lying low.

This means taking social distancing seriously. It's calling off those brunch plans with your friends, staying away from beaches and taking time to do activities at home.

Yes, it's disruptive. I get it. I would love to get together with a group of friends for a workout class or dinner at our favorite restaurant. But I'm not going to, and you shouldn't, either.

But hey, let's get real and say you did go hang out on a crowded beach and now you realize it was a mistake (possibly on many levels).

So, stay home and break the chain of contagion. The fate of tens of thousands -- possibly hundreds of thousands -- comes down to a handful of individual decisions.

Let's make a pact and commit to social distancing and protecting those we care most about. Call your friends and family, binge-watch your favorite shows, hold a virtual book group -- heck, take lots of naps. We'll get back to brunches and concerts once we've taken action, flattened the curve and shared social media posts about the importance of young people laying low.

(CNN) As the novel coronavirus pandemic has spread, it has required rapid and creative problem solving as well as the enactment of public health measures that two months ago seemed like science fiction. We are now facing the possibility that the American health care system could become overwhelmed in the coming months. Experts have warned that not only would this result in a shortage of hospital beds and ventilators, but also a shortage of the healthcare workforce required to treat patients.

Rebecca Allen

However, even as hospitals create contingency plans to address the coming staff shortages, many medical students nationwide, including us, are being shielded from any possible contact with Covid-19 patients. Some students are even being pulled from their rotations entirely.

The common thinking appears to be that is that it is unethical to require medical students, people paying tuition to be in the hospital, to put themselves at risk of contracting this infection -- or that students are not yet prepared to treat victims of this crisis.

Medical school is a four-year education, the final two years of which are almost exclusively a series of clinical apprenticeships with resident and attending physicians called "rotations." We argue that fourth-year medical students should have the option to serve the healthcare system as fully trained assets alongside interns and residents in this unique time of need. Medical schools in the UK have been asked to consider fast-tracking their senior medical students -- and America should do the same.

Before starting clinical rotations, medical students are required to undergo standardized training in proper personal protective equipment (PPE) use, including masks, gloves, gowns and best practices in workplace safety. We are knowledgeable about how to avoid spreading infections. What's more, medical students are not asked to refrain from participating in the care of patients who have dozens of other infectious diseases, spread through droplet and/or airborne means, including tuberculosis and influenza. Rather, we are reminded of the importance PPE and to take precautions when caring for those who may be contagious.

(CNN) Americans are responding to the growing coronavirus pandemic by stocking up on essentials like toilet paper, eggs, milk -- and deadly guns and ammunition. But all of that firepower is likely to do more harm than good, as Americans continue to grapple with the anxiety and uncertainty ahead.

Across the country, firearm shops are reporting a boom in sales , as customers line up to buy ammunition, handguns, shotguns, rifles -- and even the deadliest of assault weapons.

"When I say sales have been booming, it's an understatement," David Stone, who works at Dong's Guns, Ammo and Reloading in Tulsa, Oklahoma, told the Los Angeles Times.

Indeed, as one New York Times story phrased it, the FBI has processed "more background checks in February than it had done in all but two other months." Online websites like Ammo.com are also reporting a 68% increase in sales over the last month.

But doomsday preppers and gun enthusiasts aren't the only ones buying the nation's gun and ammo inventory. Anecdotal reports from gun shop owners suggest that first-time purchasers are also getting in on the action.

For example, Gabriel Vaughn, the owner of Sportsman's Arms in Petaluma, California, posted a video on Instagram, on March 14, noting a "huge influx in new, first-time buyers" and pleading with his regular clientele to be mindful of busy store staff during this period.

"I can barely lift my head up to say hello to people," Vaughn said.

Similarly, Cole Gaughran of Wade's Eastside Guns in Bellevue, Washington, reported an increase in first-time gun owners -- particularly among the Asian-American community.

"The main thing I'm hearing is that they don't want to get jumped because of their race," he told The Trace.

The reported influx of new customers and uptick in background checks must be a welcome turnaround for an industry that has experienced sluggish sales over the last several years -- and its boosters are actively exploiting the coronavirus outbreak to help grow profits further.

Last Friday, the National Rifle Association sent out an inflammatory "national alert" to its millions of members warning that "anti-gun extremists" in Champaign, Illinois, are using the emergency "to quietly pass and implement gun control schemes."

Later that day, the city, which had issued an emergency declaration related to the coronavirus, issued a statement to respond to "false claims" about its order, pointing out that "there is currently no firearm ban and no intent to seize property or close businesses." A lawyer for the city said that using these powers would require city council approval.

The gun and ammunition rush could lead to a spike in firearm suicides and domestic violence incidents, however.

As Los Angeles County Sheriff Alex Villanueva explained during a press conference on Monday, "buying guns is a bad idea."

"You have a lot of people now who are at home, normally they're not, cabin fever sets in and you have a crowded environment," he said. "Weapons are not a good mix."

Indeed, research has consistently found that firearms in the home significantly increase instances of suicide homicide -- and unintentional shootings.

The Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health has concluded that "every study that has examined the issue to date has found that within the U.S., access to firearms is associated with increased suicide risk," with one analysis showing that "suicides were almost twice as high in the high-gun states, even though non-firearm suicides were about equal."

Other researchers found that residents in states with higher rates of gun ownership are more likely to be shot and killed by a family member or an intimate partner, with women facing the greatest risk. Each 10% increase in household gun ownership rates corresponded with a 13% increase in domestic firearm homicides, researchers at the University of Indianapolis reported in 2017.

States with more guns also see more unintentional deaths . The mortality rate is seven times higher "in the four states with the most guns compared to the four states with the fewest guns," the Harvard researchers tell us.

And, so, if the best way to stop the coronavirus pandemic is to listen to the guidance of health professionals and scientists, then Americans must also tune out the grifters who are using this crisis to sell more firearms and embrace the overwhelming and conclusive science around the dangers of gun ownership.

If you're looking to protect your family, continue to buy food and basic essentials as needed, not guns and ammunition -- and then stay home. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

"Yeah, why not?" I responded, revisiting the kitschy yet sanctified rites of passage that punctuated my adolescence.

And so that early March afternoon, in a stunningly decorated space nestled in the woods of Westchester County, we celebrated a girl's symbolic transition into womanhood.

But what had been a blithe, plus-one adventure soon became a lengthy quarantine at the epicenter of a national public health emergency -- and one for which hard-fought testing came about two weeks too late.

As the experts have told us time and time again, one of the only ways to stave off widespread societal devastation is for testing to be readily accessible. My saga proves we are far from achieving that goal.

A party with an unfortunate twist

Several days after the bat mitzvah, New York's second case of novel coronavirus would emerge in New Rochelle -- the very same city that was home to most of the party's attendees and the very same city that would soon house a containment zone. At the time of the event, coronavirus was new to the United States -- a fearsome threat in Washington state that might eventually make its way east.

At the event, many tables were outfitted with Purell, and there was a sense that people were being a bit more contemplative about contact and hygiene. Nevertheless, people still mingled and noshed and held hands to dance in the concentric circles typical of any Jewish affair. And that was fine, because no one in New York state was known to have Covid-19, and the local risk wasn't yet palpable enough to warrant cancellations and social distancing.

As we know now, the problem is that the specter of coronavirus is not only about you -- it's about everyone around you. Days later, I was in disbelief when I heard that a New Rochelle man had tested positive. But he wasn't at the event, like so many of his friends and neighbors, so we were alright, right?

One week later, after a full week of work, volunteering, Bikram yoga and life in general, I learned that at least five guests had tested positive, and that the Department of Health was encouraging everyone present to enter a precautionary quarantine for 14 days.

I had been concerned since the New Rochelle news broke, and by the end of the week I had started to feel a little off, enough to seclude myself at home. So, by the time the news of the New Rochelle quarantine reached me, I was unsurprised and, frankly, expecting it.

More concerned for older relatives' prospects than my own, I unreservedly accepted the mantle of quarantine, and withdrew from professional life (without paid sick leave or telework) and listened to the television experts' vague directive to "hunker down" as I considered the irony of contracting a deadly virus at a kids' party I wasn't even invited to.

The struggle to get tested

Like so many Americans, I lacked confidence in the government's preparedness, particularly since Vice President Mike Pence had failed to produce the roughly 1.5 million tests he had promised by the end of the first week in March.

My first call was to the Westchester Department of Health, which informed me that quarantine meant staying inside, all day, without exception, unless seeking medical treatment. It also meant no visitors -- friends or family. Much to my surprise, the DOH was accessible, knowledgeable and responsive in recording my information and symptoms, and in scheduling a home testing visit within 48 hours. It was almost too easy.

I waited, confident that the DOH was working its way over. Above all, I was grateful to be quarantining at home, and not in a ship cabin sepulcher, like so many Americans aboard the Diamond Princess. My contentment dissipated after 48 hours lapsed without a visit or a word of explanation.

I followed up with the DOH, and instead of the hopeful assurances I received the first time, they informed me that I was now low priority, a level six out of seven, and that they could no longer specify if and when they'd come to test me. I was happy to have the government attend to higher-priority individuals first, but at the same time I was now nine days out from exposure and felt it was important that I understand my status and its implications.

Tired of lying in wait, I tapped into my political acumen to see if my local representative, Assemblyman Jeffrey Dinowitz, could advocate on my behalf. I received an eager, proactive response from one of his staffers, who referred my case to Gov. Andrew Cuomo's office, and indicated that I would hear back that day.

Well, I didn't hear back, and the night proved dramatic as Tom Hanks announced that he and his wife, Rita Wilson, had tested positive for coronavirus. My quarantine was due to end in a few days (two weeks since exposure and one week since quarantine), and time was running out.

I awoke with the fiery resolve of Erin Brockovich. Every hour, the news reported new cases in New York, so people were getting tested somewhere, but I hadn't figured out how. I called my primary care physician, who was referring all Covid-19 inquiries to the ER, though the federal government was urging people to avoid making unannounced visits to the ER.

I then contacted my state senator, Alessandra Biaggi, and one of her senior staffers gave me the invaluable tip that a local clinic was testing. Since the DOH had ostensibly scrapped house calls and ghosted me, this seemed like my best bet.

Per quarantine protocol, I called ahead and was told that I might get a test if I "qualified." Five days since I had seen the sun, I packed my bag with an array of disinfectants, wrapped a bandana around my face and embarked on a 40-minute walk to avoid exposing anyone via bus or taxi. It was then that I walked through a waiting room of blue masks and experienced one of the most crushing moments of this experience, a moment that truly embodied this saga.

A kind physician, suited up in several layers of protective gear with a plastic shield across her face, examined me and said, "I disagree with the DOH. I don't think you're low priority; I think you're high priority. I would like to test you now, but I can't, because you don't meet FDA and DOH criteria."

These guidelines specified that in order to qualify for a test my body temperature had to be above 100.5 degrees, and that my blood oxygen saturation had to be below 95%. Well, my temperature was 98.5, and my blood oxygen was 99%, so no dice. Given my symptoms, comorbid asthma, negative flu test, and early exposure at New York's Covid-19 ground zero, she even made an unsuccessful appeal on my behalf.

The doctor instructed me to add a week to my quarantine in the absence of a test and to call back the following day in case regulations loosened. And thus, 11 days after exposure, I came within reach of a critical test -- until red tape barred a willing physician from administering it. Just because you can find one, doesn't mean you can get one.

Unwilling to quit

Please understand that nearly every public servant and healthcare provider offered me dizzying, and often conflicting, information. Just that day, local government had suggested I go to my doctor, my doctor had referred me to the ER, and the federal government was discouraging many people from rushing to the ER.

At the same time, I cannot deny that everyone involved is well-meaning, overworked and struggling to demystify ever-fluctuating guidelines. Not exactly a best-case emergency management scenario.

I walked out and, unwilling to quit, I checked back in with my assemblyman. This time, two senior staffers informed me that current protocol dictated that constituents petition their doctors for tests, an unsatisfying piece of advice that suggested the state government was passing the buck back down to lower echelons. These staffers recommended they conference in as I called my primary care physician again, which sadly accomplished nothing beyond hearing a doctor's frustration at the absence of resources and protocol.

She told me that a colleague of hers, a pregnant doctor, had been denied a test when she went to the ER with severe Covid-19 symptoms. As healthcare providers, these people had no idea how to access testing themselves, and they were exasperated.

When I returned to quarantine, I scanned the wasteland of Post-it notes that littered my desk with names, numbers and half-baked instructions of every stripe. I gave the DOH hotline another shot, just to speak with an emotionally threadbare representative who told me that the case I had opened in the beginning was inactive and inaccessible, and that it sounded like I had the flu (despite my insistence that I had tested negative hours earlier).

The next morning -- Day 6 of quarantine and 12 days following exposure -- all of these maddening efforts started to build momentum. "Enough already," I was told Dinowitz had said when he personally placed a call to the governor's office demanding a test.

A friend on Capitol Hill connected me to someone in Sen. Chuck Schumer's office. Another offered to connect me to Rep. Eliot Engel (D-NY), and Albany was finally calling me back. However, the act that surpassed these efforts to navigate the American polity was just a simple, unexpected phone call from the physician who had denied me a test the day before.

On her day off, she called to tell me that she had been thinking about my case all night, and that she wished she had silently defied the rules to test me out of principle. But that didn't matter anymore, because the criteria had indeed loosened and I finally qualified! I rushed back to the clinic on March 13 with the air of having traversed a battlefield, brutalized, but not defeated.

Success comes at a cost

"Out of the 30 patients I've screened for coronavirus today, you're only the second person that I think actually has it," my new physician stated.

My heart rate was elevated, indicating a low-grade fever that I had not detected at home. When he listened to my chest, my right lung sounded dyspneic, labored and deprived of air.

"Are you sure you don't feel short of breath?" he asked.

"I guess I didn't realize until now," I replied.

I had been so immersed in my mission, and so accustomed to respiratory abnormalities as an asthmatic, that I hadn't even noticed that my breathing was impaired. Then, in a moment I hardly believed had arrived, he performed the test, an uncomfortable but quick procedure in which he inserted a thin, pipe cleaner-like nasopharyngeal swab through my nose, into my throat.

I won't receive results for five to seven days. By the time I receive them, nearly three weeks will have elapsed from the time of exposure, and nearly two weeks from my first attempt to be tested. Given the exponential rate with which this virus has overtaken the globe, this is an unacceptable and positively dangerous amount of time from the perspective of containment and "flattening the curve." If I prove to be positive, three weeks is ample time for the virus to have spread from the few people I may have exposed to hundreds or thousands more.

This experience has taught me that we, as individuals, are not always attuned to our bodies or capable of accurate symptom assessment without professional input. Moreover, I learned that there appears to be no singular being or body that's truly in charge on the ground, and there's no foolproof protocol.

In the meantime, each affected individual must demand personal attention and systemic reform so that we can make our best play for catch-up containment. Reach out to the officials who represent you, lobby them, turn up the heat and see what they can do for you. After all, you elected them, they are beholden to you, and they may even care about you and want to help. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) Berea College, a small tuition-free school nestled in Appalachia, went first. As schools like Harvard, Princeton, Amherst and others shifted to all-online education as the coronavirus outbreak deepened and began expelling most of their students from campus , Berea's leaders took a different approach. The school's administration acknowledged that members of the student body had widely divergent access to the internet (something that is likely true to some degree at most, if not all, institutions of higher learning), and told Berea's professors to stop teaching.

By the end of last week, hundreds of schools had suspended in-person teaching, but most seemed to be promoting the idea that assessment with letter grades could continue as planned. Some academic leaders, though, quickly figured out that the only way through this was to abandon pretensions of rigor or normality, shifting their entire universities to a pass/fail option in an attempt to ease tensions and recognize the anxiety of the moment.

That's a good move. When pass and fail are the only options, it allows the grader to focus on learning and growth, while students have more opportunities to try, mess up and improve without feeling that everything is lost or their GPA is ruined.

We're all going to be messing up a lot in this unprecedented moment anyway. Everyone should shift to a pass/fail basis for a while, cutting each other as much slack as possible, while still acknowledging the work we're all doing, staying connected and trying to remember what normal looks like.

The Massachusetts Institute of Technology was one of the first schools to announce that all grades would shift from A-F into a pass/fail system Northwestern University and The City Universities of New York have all followed suit with similar policies, and surely by now others have joined in. Some schools have shifted to a purely pass/fail basis, whereas others are leaving the choice up to students by simply extending the deadline to change their grading option until the end of the semester.

While there are reasonable debates to be had about the fairest fair way to go forward, from what I can tell, too few schools have taken this seemingly radical step. For many, assessing and ranking students feels essential to the function of a university. Strong students want grades as markers of their success. But in this moment of crisis, we're all just going to have to relax and accept that the chaotic world we're living in right now demands a different approach.

At their best, grades are not in fact always all that useful ; often, they reveal as much about the conditions in which a student is able to work as their raw ability or effort. I spent a decade teaching first-generation students -- often also first-generation Americans -- at a small college in Chicago. Many were brilliant. Many also had to care for younger members of their family, work 30-40 hours a week and often experienced both food and housing insecurity. They didn't always do their best work, because life got in their way.

I learned to shift my standards, not by lowering them exactly, but to emphasize growth and intention over flawless execution. I tried to let empathy moderate the pursuit of rigor and perfection in which I had been trained. Through a pedagogy of kindness and trust , I helped my students achieve great things; they often exceeded my highest expectations.

We're all going to need to prioritize empathy, kindness and trust as we move through the next few weeks and maybe months. Students are going through profound dislocations because of the coronavirus pandemic and simply cannot be expected to do good work while moving, being isolated, shifting to online learning and other changes. This is as true for younger students as for those in college or graduate school, and we're just going to have to take that into account.

Faculty also need to be judged on a pass/fail basis. Online teaching is uniquely hard and cannot be mastered as a skill in a couple of hours or days. Student evaluations -- which for pre-tenure or pre-promotion faculty are vitally important to their career advancement -- will be useless in this new arrangement, as will any evaluations of research productivity.

This is also true in nearly every industry. Every resume, transcript, curriculum vitae and work history is going to look weird when it comes to spring 2020. At large companies, employees typically get assessed annually based on their ability to meet performance goals. Those goals should be thrown away and every employee treated (as Facebook has reportedly done) as if they " exceed expectations " across categories. Anyone who shows up and tries to keep going should get an A+. College admissions officers and hiring managers alike take note: We should all get maximum credit for just making it through the spring intact.

And if we need to go pass/fail in all of our work and education, we need it even more in our home life. Relationships will get strained. None of us will always be able to practice optimal parenting strategies, especially as parents figure out how to balance working from home and caring for our kids at the same time. My children are on iPads even as I write this, though allegedly my daughter is playing a math game.

It's not that we have to look the other way on abuse or neglect, but competency rather than excellence should be the goal. This is also true when we judge ourselves. I'd love to think that in the next few weeks I'm going to rewrite my novel and draft multiple chapters of my history book, all while continuing to make pasta from scratch and providing excellent advising to my students whenever they need it. More realistically, let's just try to keep our productivity and relationships at what in other times we might have rated a B-, while hoping for better, and weathering this storm with maximum compassion for ourselves and everyone around us.

With one exception: Our leaders do not get this benefit of the doubt, because our lives are at stake. Turning us into a pass/fail nation is about lowering anxiety and giving our leaders time to make up for the weeks in which the Trump administration downplayed the threat

Sarah Carlson, MD, MSC, is a surgeon at Boston VA Medical Center and assistant professor of surgery at Boston University. Follow her on Twitter @sarahcarlsonmd. The views expressed here are the author's. View more opinion on CNN.

(CNN) Like most Americans, I've spent the last several days learning to alter my daily life in the context of this unfamiliar construct of "social distancing." As a surgeon in the midst of preparing for the challenges of Covid-19, the disease caused by the novel coronavirus, I am beginning to worry about the implications of what I call "patient distancing" --separating families from their loved ones in hospitals and long-term care facilities.

Sarah Carlson

Part of my job, aside from treating patients with vascular diseases, is helping families navigate their loved ones' illness. When I finish an operation, my first stop is the surgical waiting room where I meet with family and friends of my patient and let them know the surgery is complete. The most common question I'm asked is when the visitors can see their loved one. Beyond hearing the patient is doing well, the family wants to be by his or her side, see for themselves, and offer some comfort of their own.

A few years ago, I was not the doctor but the loved one. I was with my sister Lyn when she took her last breath. At 31 years old, she lost her lifelong battle with cystic fibrosis after years of hospitalizations, intubations, ICU stays and even a double lung transplant. She was my only sibling.

Lyn passed away at a university hospital after receiving top-notch care by a team of experts who, for many years, fought her illness with us as a family. Never did we have to consider that there might not be a ventilator for her when she (frequently) had pneumonia. Never were there too few doctors, nurses or respiratory therapists available to attend to her many needs, day or night. And, perhaps most importantly, there were always sufficient healthcare workers to attend to our family.

Never were we denied the ability to be with my sister in the hospital. My mother, father and I took turns, for countless nights, sleeping in the ICU next to her, with one of us always perched near her bed like a guard dog in a semi-reclining vinyl hospital chair. When she died, she did so peacefully, surrounded by all of us as we rubbed her feet and held her hands. We took comfort in being there together as a family when she passed away.

(CNN) If, like me, you've been receiving emails from most every organization you're involved with saying that classes, lectures, services, and other planned events are now being conducted online amid the coronavirus crisis, you've almost certainly noticed a trend.

With so many of us already connecting with our communities through social media and smartphones, we have already taken big steps away from physical proximity as the core of our human intimacy. What we are now witnessing is a quantum leap toward the virtualization of our lives.

Over the coming weeks we'll see more of this. It won't just be the Vatican Easter services and US presidential debates being held without large audiences.

As the virus spreads across populations, it is also likely that an increasing number of health professionals will be infected and need to be quarantined. With the number of patients rising rapidly and the available healthcare professionals declining, we'll be forced to rely on telemedicine and artificial intelligence diagnostics to get through this.

Companies like Amazon have been experimenting with cashier-less stores, but with human cashiers either not able to make it to work or concerned about touching goods handled by others, this trend will speed up.

Welcome to our disembodied future.

Our move away from physical connectivity since the days of the telegraph has extended the breadth of our networks and helped bring people together in new and meaningful ways -- but it has also come at a cost. There's a reason why studies show that infants who don't receive enough physical attention often have social and emotional problems later in life , and why we think of solitary confinement as a punishment rather than a cosmic Buddhist reward.

Our deep human need for intimate, physical connectivity with others is coded into our DNA. That deep social interconnectivity was central to our ancestors' competitive success.

This physical isolation translates into high rates of depression. A 2018 US national survey found that nearly half of American adults sometimes or always feel alone. Research at Brigham Young University found that social isolation had the equivalent negative health impact as smoking 15 cigarettes a day.

We need to promote social distancing, quarantine and self-isolation to save lives. And we should restrict visits to places like our nursing homes and prisons to stanch the spread of the coronavirus. But one consequence of this is that people will be pushed toward even greater levels of social isolation.

Just like the artificial intelligence revolution is forcing us to assess what work is most appropriate for humans, this sudden virtualization revolution will force us to redefine the foundations of our connectivity with others. We need to ask ourselves whether our core need for physical human connectivity can be at least partly met in other ways. As we wisely adopt physical social distancing we must simultaneously embrace virtual emotional closening.

Here are my seven essential steps that we can take to do so:

1. Find ourselves: The core of connectivity with others is peace with ourselves. As tempting as it may be to sit in front of our televisions watching the crisis loop in 30-minute intervals, we must re-center ourselves to safeguard our well-being today and prepare for what's heading our way tomorrow. For some, this might mean mediation, for others it might mean writing in a journal, exercising, or knitting. If we are at home anyway, why not make it feel more like a Buddhist retreat and less like solitary confinement?

2. Skill up: Ever want to learn tango dancing, African drumming, or Talmud? Now you have the time to learn it all at home. You can use the thousands of free YouTube videos covering any skill you want to acquire. Or, if you are financially able to, hire experts to train you virtually. Those teachers are also sitting at home looking for meaningful things to do. Not set up for it? Baloney. Even the technologically inexperienced can call a teacher (and anyone can be a teacher), set up a FaceTime session, then mail a check, if necessary, after the virtual class.

3. Connect with your mini physical community: If you are home with a few people, why not invest in deepening your relationships with them? Have a brewing family drama separating you for years, why not fix it now? The centrifugal momentum of our previous lives often interfered with our ability to connect with the people physically closest to us. Now we have a chance to experience what life used to be like when our radius of physical movement was so much smaller.

4. Invest in virtual communities: In the villages most of our ancestors left, we kept tabs on each other -- for better and for worse. At this moment of increasing social isolation, we must embrace the better. Everyone should make a list of all the people in our lives who need a little extra attention, particularly those who are isolated in one way or another, and get in the habit of reaching out meaningfully and repeatedly.

5. Strengthen the infrastructure of virtual connectivity: Technology companies have already built the infrastructure of virtual community with tools like Zoom and Microsoft Teams that make it easier for people to meet meaningfully and intimately from afar. Now we must go a step further by setting up simple interfaces to help every place of worship, community center, book club, or other group keep our essential communities together when meeting in person is not possible.

6. Open our universities: We must turn our universities inside out so that our greatest thinkers can lead inclusive virtual conversations about the most interesting, exciting and important issues of our time. Because even people stuck at home will not want to watch boring lectures, we'll need to make this exciting and scintillating entertainment. Our universities can make it easy for every person at home to develop a personalized learning plan so we can gain new skills and knowledge while we have this precious time.

7. Recruit our elders: In our villages, respected elders played a critical role passing wisdom and knowledge to future generations. All too often, our socially isolated modern societies have exiled them to retirement homes and golf courses. Now we need those essential people back at the center of our communities where they belong. If we are virtualizing our lives, why not make it easy for our elders to do the same? There are lots of retirees with expertise that could be a great source of remote learning for students who are also stuck at home.

We all hope this crisis is just temporary and our lives will swing right back in a few months. This is certainly one possibility, but there is a real chance that the crisis could last considerably longer.

Even if a vaccine can be developed and deployed by the end of next year, it is doubtful our lives will ever go back to exactly how they were before this crisis began. What we recently called normal was just the new normal for people older than us. Our new normal of virtualized life will likely become just the normal of future generations.

We humans will always have a deep, biological need for physical connectivity with each other. That will not go away. Our new world of virtual communion will certainly come with a cost, but it also has the potential to bring us new gifts we might never otherwise have imagined.

Given that we don't -- for now at least -- have much of a choice, let's make the most of this opportunity. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) Comedy legend Mel Brooks and his son, Max, have teamed up in a new video to give us just what the doctor ordered: Comedy and facts to keep each other safer during the Covid-19 outbreak.

Dean Obeidallah

The comedy part is especially needed given that "Saturday Night Live" on Monday announced the cancellation of its next three shows, and many of the late-night talk shows such as those of Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Fallon are on hiatus until at least the end of the month in response to the virus outbreak.

In their video, which went viral, the two Brooks make the case for social distancing and taking other precautions in order to help reduce the spread of coronavirus.

It opens with Max standing behind a glass door outside his father's house, with the elder Brooks inside. Max notes that since he is 47, if he gets the virus, he'll "probably be OK."

But, he adds, pointing to his 93-year-old father, who waves hello through the glass door:

(CNN) It had been a long day, and we needed ice cream. This was last Thursday in Decatur, Georgia, a thousand years ago, when leaving the house still felt like a common occurrence. It was almost twilight, and the star magnolias were blooming. On the way we walked by a high school where no one was learning, with a field where no one was playing, and an auditorium where the spring musical had just been canceled. We stumbled on toward Dairy Queen.

Thomas Lake

Yes, it was open. No, we would not all go inside. We could see the world changing before our eyes, feel the weight of each small choice. Maybe the virus was in there, or maybe one of us had it already, and maybe we shouldn't have come at all. What if you got sick for no good reason, and you got other people sick for no good reason, and they got other people sick for no good reason, and someone died because a kid licked a table in a restaurant?

My wife and kids stayed outside. I went in alone. It was nearly deserted. Elsewhere in America, restaurants were closing: some just for now, and some forever. Good people had lost their jobs, and many more would lose them soon. Some of us would go hungry. Some would fight for one more breath. A tremor seemed to pass beneath my feet, rippling from ocean to ocean.

A kind young woman took my order: chocolate shake, strawberry shake, peanut butter shake, Reese's Peanut Butter Cup Blizzard. I stood back from the counter, grateful for the debit-card reader that let us complete the transaction without getting too close. Was this distance enough? No one knew. The young man preparing our desserts would breathe on those desserts, as would the woman handing them to me. I ate my Blizzard with a small red spoon and tried not to think too much.

We walked home, past the abandoned school, and I thought about the hierarchy of grief. You were allowed to be sad if a loved one died, or if you were freshly unemployed or if you were busy surviving some other verified catastrophe. I wanted permission to be sad about other things, too. Smaller things. No one had given it to me, so I gave it to myself. And now I give it to you.

Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America, a professor of practice at Arizona State University. His new book is "Trump and His Generals: The Cost of Chaos." The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles at CNN.

(CNN) Michael Osterholm, the infectious disease expert who has been warning for a decade and a half that the world will face a pandemic, says the US is ill-prepared to combat the coronavirus due to a shortage of equipment and supplies.

Osterholm, of the University of Minnesota, wrote in Foreign Affairs magazine in 2005 that, "This is a critical point in our history. Time is running out to prepare for the next pandemic. We must act now with decisiveness and purpose." He reiterated this point in his 2017 book, "Deadliest Enemy: Our War Against Killer Germs."

Osterholm discussed the coronavirus at a recent Washington, DC event at the New America think tank with Peter Bergen, CNN national security analyst and New America vice president.

He took issue with the idea that the flu is a more serious threat, saying the death toll from coronavirus could be much higher than that of a severe flu season. Osterholm said there's very little vacant capacity in the health care system to fully deal with the effects of the coronavirus. And he pointed out that there's a shortage of protective clothing for health care workers.

Osterholm also discussed the impact that widespread obesity might have on that fatality rate; the lack of much-needed ventilators and respirators at hospitals; the ubiquity of the virus and what that means for overseas travel, and he poured much cold water on the notion that this coronavirus might disappear as the weather warms. The discussion was edited for length and clarity.

BERGEN: Have there been any changes in the US since you warned three years ago of the failure to prepare for the next pandemic?

OSTERHOLM: We are worse off today than we were in 2017 because the health care system is stretched thinner now than ever. There is no excess capacity. And public health funding has been cut under this administration.

BERGEN: How deadly is the virus? What do you think the case fatality rate is? Is there an approximation?

OSTERHOLM: We know from the Chinese data that being a male, older and having underlying health conditions are risk factors for We know from the Chinese data that being a male, older and having underlying health conditions are risk factors for increased serious illness and deaths

For older men in China, smoking is still very common -- 60% of older males smoke.

Smoking likely played a big role in the increased risk of this demographic dying from coronavirus. We see the same trend with influenza in our own country.

Of note, only a small percentage of older women in China smoke, meaning they were much less at risk for serious disease.

We're concerned about the occurrence of other risk factors for severe disease as this virus moves out into other parts of the world. For example, one of the risk factors for acute respiratory distress syndrome, or ARDS -- the most severe of the outcomes of COVID-19 infection -- is obesity. In parts of the world, including the US, where obesity is an epidemic problem, its likely we may see a different case fatality rate than we're seeing in China; that is, US fatalities may be less gender-specific and the rate of fatalities could be even higher than it is in China due to higher obesity rates among people 45 years or older.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the case fatality rate in China to date is 3% to 4%. However, WHO has estimated it to be as low as 0.7% outside of Wuhan, the epicenter of the outbreak.

In the US -- and in other upper and middle-income countries -- we may expect to see a case fatality rate equal to or higher to what we see in China.

BERGEN: So, if in a regular year in the US, the case fatality rate of influenza is 0.1%, you're saying that COVID-19 will be higher?

OSTERHOLM: Twenty to 30 times higher. It could easily be that. We just don't know yet and it could go down based on what we learn.

BERGEN: So, if the 0.1% case fatality rate of the flu kills tens of thousands in any given year in the US, what are the implications for the coronavirus?

OSTERHOLM: It's obvious that this is a very serious challenge. I think that it was unfortunate that a number of public health professionals said early on when COVID-19 first emerged that annual influenza was a much It's obvious that this is a very serious challenge. I think that it was unfortunate that a number of public health professionals said early on when COVID-19 first emerged that annual influenza was a much more serious problem

What they hadn't understood was that they were only watching the opening scene of this particular "coronavirus winter," as I call it. We can expect to see a large number of deaths moving forward -- far surpassing any severe influenza season.

The Chinese data suggests that anywhere from 5% to 10% of COVID-19 cases will become severe illnesses. These cases require a tremendous amount of expert health care; that makes this disease even more of a challenge relative to influenza.

BERGEN: Are we equipped with the ICUs and the ventilators to deal with a large-scale group of people coming in with these kinds of symptoms?

OSTERHOLM: Absolutely not. Right now, today, in Minneapolis-St. Paul, every one of the beds that we use for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO), a high-level machine that supports the heart and lungs and is critical for keeping people alive who have illness like COVID-19, are filled. This is in part because we are just coming off a moderate to severe flu season and that has really stretched our care capacity. On top of that, a number of hospitals throughout the country have only 5 to 10 days' worth of personal protective equipment (PPE) available for health care workers. They don't know when over-stretched PPE manufacturers will be able to deliver more.

BERGEN: What can be done?

OSTERHOLM: First of all, we have to utilize the health services we have in different ways, meaning we will need to stop elective surgeries. Anybody who is not severely ill with other conditions will not be hospitalized. We need to be preparing our pandemic plan and must be thinking through what we would do if we had a 20% to 30% jump in the number of hospitalizations.

Remember, in Wuhan we had a number of people who were desperately ill, needed hospital care and couldn't get into a hospital. Many people were dying at home, not in the hospitals.

The next question is: how are we going to protect our health care workers? We need solutions that are not ideal but that may work. We need to open up wards where everyone in the ward is infected, rather than having one patient per room, meaning that health care workers must each put on and take off their PPE an average of 20 to 25 times a day. With multiple patients in a room, health care workers could potentially use the same protective equipment for much of a shift.

So, there are things we can do, but we still have a very high likelihood that we're going to face major PPE shortages. We simply don't have good answers for that right now. We'll likely have to revert back to the use of more available surgical masks in contrast to N95 respirators, which are the preferred PPE to prevent the spread of the virus between patients and health care personnel. Surgical masks, we know are largely ineffective in preventing virus transmission. Thousands of health care workers in China have become infected, many of those early in the outbreak when it wasn't completely understood just how infectious this virus is.

I believe that these cases are tied to the absence of adequate respiratory protection.

BERGEN: Are you saying that the N95 respirator is not available in any meaningful quantity?

OSTERHOLM: It's not. No health care organization has gone out and stockpiled lots of personal protective equipment. They have always bought it on a just-in-time basis. So now we're paying the price for that. (Editor's note: The US just It's not. No health care organization has gone out and stockpiled lots of personal protective equipment. They have always bought it on a just-in-time basis. So now we're paying the price for that. (Editor's note: The US just took action to make more N95 respirators available.)

When health care workers start dying or get severely ill and they go from being care providers to needing care -- and hospitals are not able to handle patients because of a reduced number of health care workers -- I think that's when you run the risk of people losing confidence in its government and leaders.

One thing I worry desperately about is this virus in long-term care. The current experience in the Seattle metro area with the number of infected long-term care facilities shows how devastating COVID-19 can be in this setting. If you take out most of the long-term care workers with infection and you have sick patients, who takes care of them? This is going to be a huge challenge.

BERGEN: Last week the FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn promised that there would be Last week the FDA Commissioner Stephen Hahn promised that there would be 1 million coronavirus tests available by the end of the week -- but that was an unattainable goal in such a short timeframe.

What do you make of that?

OSTERHOLM: We're going to see most state health departments clearly having the capacity to test in all 50 States and at least 12 or 15 large city health departments in the near future.

But we didn't have the kind of testing here in this country that much of the rest of the world has enjoyed for at least four to five weeks.

BERGEN: Why was that?

OSTERHOLM: In short, the CDC had a problem with Plan A, in other words making a coronavirus test available for the US. And nobody at CDC had a Plan B, C, or D. This was a real failure.

What I think frustrated health professionals is that we knew we likely had widespread transmission ongoing. Unfortunately, this lack of testing reinforced the fantasy that we somehow had stopped transmission of the virus from coming into this country. What I have said many times over the past six weeks is all we really did was fix three of the five screen doors in our submarine. In fact, we knew that we had cases coming into the States despite the fact that restrictions on flying to or from China and airport temperature screening may have slowed down the rate of new infections. Containment of this virus and preventing it from getting into the US was never possible, despite what some government leaders proclaimed.

Look at the situation in Seattle. There was a case that was detected in January when upon return from China an individual became ill. This person was put in isolation, but not before he had been in the community. Nonetheless our response to this case this largely considered a great success in terms of stopping ongoing transmission. As we now know, at least one of the patients who was tested in Seattle, another individual six weeks later, was infected with the same strain. It's likely that original virus introduction into the Seattle area did occur with this January case, meaning that there had to be at least six or seven generations of transmission between the time that the individual first arrived in the United States from China back in January and this new case. So, we've had ongoing transmission in this country for weeks.

BERGEN: We've had other coronaviruses like SARS and MERS, which, although highly problematic, didn't really kill very many people, relatively speaking. What's the difference between this coronavirus and those coronaviruses?

OSTERHOLM: This is a very, very different coronavirus. Think of this as an influenza pandemic caused by a coronavirus and you're thinking about this in the right way.

SARS had close to 10% case fatality rate. MERS has a case fatality rate of 25% to 35%. The COVID-19 virus has a case fatality rate that is somewhere between seasonal flu in a bad year, which is 0.1% , and the 1918 pandemic, which, of course, preferentially killed young adults with a case fatality rate of 2.5% to 3% . So this is clearly in that range of what would be considered a severe influenza pandemic if this were the influenza virus.

When we think about infectious disease transmission, we refer to the concept of RO (a term that indicates how contagious an infectious disease is) or how many people on average an individual transmits the virus to. And what we see with coronavirus is it's probably about an RO of 2 to 2.5. It's surely dynamic. If we consider regular influenza, it's about 1.4. If you think about pandemic influenza, it tends to be about 1.8 people. So, this is quite different.

What's different here is the fact that in the cases of SARS and MERS -- and I was very involved with both outbreak investigations -- patients were most infectious on day 5 or later, and it allowed us the opportunity to identify these patients early in their illness and get them into appropriate isolation. Here, virus transmission is occurring early in illness, likely even before symptoms show up. It is very similar to influenza.

BERGEN: How does this coronavirus pandemic unfold?

OSTERHOLM: Well this outbreak from our perspective has really unfolded on time, and what I mean by that is even in the second week of January, it was very clear that this was no longer going to be a MERS- or a SARS-like situation with transmission only later in the illness. It was much more dynamic. Clearly, it was acting very much like an influenza virus; we were not going to be able to control it. This is influenza-like transmission, and it's going to continue for some time to come.

So, the fact that we went from 26 countries with cases of the virus 14 days ago to over 80 countries with cases now shouldn't surprise us. An extraordinary amount of new transmission is occurring everyday all over the world.

In our country there is widespread transmission going on now. It's just being missed, and as soon as we have testing, we're going to see it.

Let me make one point really clear; which I think has not received sufficient discussion. We keep hearing that this is going to die out with the spring warmer weather in the Northern Hemisphere. SARS ended in 2003 in June, but it had nothing to do with the seasons at all. It took until June of 2003 to understand how to stop transmission and then carry out our prevention activities. This had nothing to do with the seasonality of SARS. I've investigated outbreaks of MERS on the Arabian Peninsula when it was 110 degrees.

The other thing that seems to support the conclusion that there will be seasonality with COVID-19 is the seasonal nature of influenza. In fact, while there is seasonal influenza in the two hemispheres, it occurs year-round in the tropics. And of the last 10 influenza pandemics, two started in the winter, three in the spring, two in the summer and three in the fall. We have no evidence from what we know about influenza to suggest that COVID-19 will subside with summer in the Northern Hemisphere.

So, is it going to be like the typical seasonal flu year where 8% to 15% of the population gets infected? We don't know. It could be a lot more. One model from the Harvard School of Public Health, the model I find most reliable, estimates that, at minimum, 20% of the world's population will get infected.

That's why even when we talk about the case fatality rate, it's important to remember that if there's a disease that has a very high rate but only 100 people get it every year, that's not nearly of the same public health significance as a disease that has a low case fatality rate of 1%, but a billion people get it.

AUDIENCE QUESTION: Is closing down schools or businesses for a period of time an effective measure to control the spread of the virus, and if so, what would be the optimal length of time for these to be closed?

OSTERHOLM: We need to start to normalize our response to this, and what I mean is that we have to be thoughtful, and we can't just knee-jerk. Right now, we've all been struck by the relative absence of cases in kids in China -- We need to start to normalize our response to this, and what I mean is that we have to be thoughtful, and we can't just knee-jerk. Right now, we've all been struck by the relative absence of cases in kids in China -- 2.1% of cases are 19 years of age or younger.

I'm all for closing schools if we show that kids are important transmitters of the virus, but school closings have tremendous negative impact on communities. And they often disproportionately affect lower socioeconomic status individuals. If parents have to stay home with their kids, then some don't get paid. So, one of the things that we don't want to do is react without data.

For businesses, this is one area where it's a major challenge. We've got to keep the lights on. We've got to keep food coming, and we've got to keep really critical drugs coming. I hope we can keep businesses running as much as possible.

I think quarantining people coming back from high-risk countries today is largely unproductive. I say this knowing I'm probably not in the majority voice and this idea is surely not popular. Based on this approach, you could just as easily make the case that we should be quarantining or issuing a travel alert to King and Snohomish Counties (in Washington State) as we do for China, Iran, Korea and Italy. We've got a lot of virus transmission around the world right now. How many places can you cordon off before you finally say: "Oh well, you know, we're all walled off here in the United States, and we're just as bad."

We need to start normalizing our COVID-19 response. Don't prevent air travel; there's just as many people likely in this country that are going to pose a risk as people coming back from abroad. That's the kind of thinking we need to start having now.

I do have concern about that some people are highly reliant right now on the use of face mask (i.e. surgical mask) protection and think that's going to reduce transmission. It is not. We are urging that all N95s respirators be used by health care workers or critical infrastructure workers only, not for the general public.

AUDIENCE QUESTION: I have travel plans to Indonesia and the Philippines in a few weeks, should I go?

OSTERHOLM: Assume this virus is everywhere. This is a global influenza pandemic caused by a coronavirus.

The President was not lying when he got up in front of the country and described the small number of cases we had confirmed. That was true, but did it reflect the reality of what was happening? Absolutely not. Many countries around the world may have some of the same problems of testing and may be unaware of the scope of the virus. So, I would just assume it's everywhere.

Anybody who has ever been to Jakarta, Indonesia knows there are a lot of people there. You're going to likely increase the chances of being exposed and getting infected with this increased number of contacts. What will you do if you need hospitalization? Do you want to be hospitalized in Indonesia?

Now, I would tell you, if you have a chance to go on a cruise ship right now, I'd bypass that one. Cruise ships have been notoriously a problem with respiratory-transmitted agents because of all the recirculated air that occurs in the inside cabins. I would have told you that well before the Diamond Princess happened.

If you do travel internationally, I don't think that it'll put you at a much higher risk than flying domestically in the US. But do you want to get hospitalized in Country X and do you know that you can get back into the United States without a 14-day quarantine? These are questions that make me hesitant to do international travel right now.

AUDIENCE QUESTION: There are a whole lot of people in this country who don't have paid sick time, and I'm wondering what there is that we can do in the short term to encourage those people to actually not come to work if they are sick?

OSTERHOLM: Every workplace setting today should be discussing this right now with their employees. Tell them what we know about COVID-19. Tell them what we're going to do when our first coworker is infected. The more information you can give to employees the more responsibly they will respond when the case numbers begin to climb. If remote working is possible, tell employees do it, but help them understand one critical prevention point: If you work remotely for 70% of the day but then you spend the night out at a restaurant or in large crowds, you've minimized all that you did during the day to protect yourself.

There are some who have said that this virus is only transmitted from the hand to the face and that's simply not true.

And, frankly, hand washing may play some role in this, but not nearly as much as people think.

(CNN) Cough into your elbow, wash your hands and stay home. Those are the patriotic acts of 2020 as we live through a global pandemic and each try to "flatten the curve" of the viral spread. Let's do our part to slow the transmission and not overwhelm our hospitals. The choice to stay away from friends is nothing compared to choosing which sick patient should get a ventilator. Simple sacrifices by American citizens can go a long way toward recovery.

This is not the first time that small, seemingly insignificant acts have taken on life or death meaning. Recycling a rusty screw, a bent nail, an old tire -- that might not seem like much. But during World War II that was everything. Thousands of miles away from the battlefield, Americans on the home front could help defeat the Nazis and save democracy if only they listened to their leaders and collected all their scrap metal. Together, piece by piece, towns could donate enough for a bullet or a gun or a tank.

It took as much as 900 tons of metal to make one naval ship, but their effort made a dent.

World War II poster

And that was only one of countless ways the country, at the behest of government, rallied behind its troops and made small sacrifices for a bigger cause , so materials normally used for domestic consumption could be allocated for the war effort. Repair a shirt rather than buy a new one, paint on nylons instead of wearing the real thing, go without cuffs on your pants; indeed, women wore pants instead of skirts since that used less fabric. Their bathing suits shrank. The fewer pairs of stockings worn by women, the more nylon available to use for parachutes.

Nearly every consumer item could be -- and had to be -- re-purposed for war, all the way down to chewing gum. The Army alone ordered hundreds of millions of pants and underwear and half a billion socks for the troops.

The War Production Board banned men's suits from including cuffs and restricted the length of their shirts . And there were other instructions, too: Buy only your rationed share of sugar, don't spend extra money at the butcher to get a thicker cut of meat above your government-allotted allowance, make a peanut butter loaf instead of a meat loaf.

Citizens, including children, pitch in by collecting scrap metal

Starting with Eleanor Roosevelt at the White House, 20 million women signed a pledge to purchase only their fair share and surrender their ration coupons.

As millions of working Americans were brought into the federal income tax system for the first time, the Roosevelt administration explained their contribution through an ad campaign featuring Donald Duck quacking "Taxes to Defeat the Axis."

But it was the appeal to small acts of patriotism that made a profound difference. Those rusty nails really did help. More than that, these acts bred a sense of patriotic self-sacrifice and encouraged a mobilization to that end.

World War II poster

That happened because of good leadership. A good president can make you feel the urgent necessity of washing your hands after sneezing into a tissue so that your grandmother will be safe and avoid needlessly adding to the workload of doctors and health care workers tasked with healing the sick.

In 1942, Franklin Roosevelt asked each citizen for an "equality of sacrifice" -- each doing their part to assist the nation. As men were dying in combat, he said in a fireside chat, "there is one front and one battle where everyone in the United States -- every man, woman, and child -- is in action, and will be privileged to remain in action throughout this war. That front is right here at home, in our daily lives, and in our daily tasks. Here at home everyone will have the privilege of making whatever self-denial is necessary..."

He went on to explain: "'sacrifice' is not exactly the proper word with which to describe this program of self-denial. When, at the end of this great struggle, we shall have saved our free way of life, we shall have made no 'sacrifice.'"

The precautionary efforts officials are asking of us to fight the coronavirus are an opportunity to renew our civic mindedness -- to wake up from our selfish slumbers and take action. If President Trump won't appeal effectively or directly to our better selves, other than thin comments that came way too late, listen to all the other mayors, governors, corporate executives, union leaders, clergy and doctors who are asking us to make small sacrifices for the greater good. As hard as it is to stay indoors and self quarantine, it will be great to know that in a crisis we each did our part.

(CNN) As the coronavirus spreads, so do cancellations of conferences, trips, flights, schools, study-abroad programs and other events. In the wake of these axed plans, employers, colleges, employers, conference hosts and attendees are scrambling to find ways to salvage the time and resources spent on the canceled events or the money lost by telling workers to stay home.

However incomplete, solutions rely on technology: working remotely via Slack channels or Google hangouts, using Zoom for conference calls, videotaping and uploading lectures, sharing and storing files on Google Drive -- and other app-related workarounds.

Joelle Renstrom

User-friendly technological solutions are lifesavers in situations like this, preventing many operations from coming to a grinding halt. In addition to keeping people safe and enabling employment, remote work arrangements preserve continuity and allow people to stay busy doing something familiar during a time of crisis. The same technologies are also a lifeline for those at high risk or in quarantine. When humans use technology in this way, our trust in it increases; according to the Pew Research Center, that trust is "fluid" and depends largely on circumstance.

The more we trust technology, the more we use it. And the more we use it, the harder and less likely it becomes for us to reel back our dependence. (Would you trade Google Maps for paper ones or have a landline installed in your home?)

The novel coronavirus has already galvanized an accelerated adoption of intermediary technologies that replace firsthand experiences. That trend will be difficult, if not impossible, to reverse, which ultimately may hasten the obsolescence of human workers. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Queen performs at Live Aid in London in 1985. (Neal Preston)

It’s been more than 33 years since Queen, spearheaded by their electric front man Freddie Mercury, charged onto the stage of the 1985 Live Aid concert and performed the set often lauded as the greatest live gig of all time.

The release of “Bohemian Rhapsody,” the Queen biopic starring Rami Malek as Mercury, has provoked a swell of nostalgia and emotion around that moment in musical history. In the spirit of the unabashedly uncool band itself, I’d like to add my voice to the chorus.

First, a confession: I wasn’t even alive when Queen played Live Aid. I was born three years later in 1988, three years before Mercury died of bronchial pneumonia resulting from AIDS.

My first proper introduction came when I was about seven, when someone had left the TV on at home. There was a documentary about Queen, whose thumping, chanty music I had recently identified as “more entertaining than the Beatles” on car journeys. I sat down. By the time the program reached the Live Aid concert, I was hooked. By the end of that segment I was in love with Mercury, and when half an hour later I learned that he was dead, I was heartbroken.

Confronted with everything in such quick succession, the tragedy and speed of his death a few years later seemed only to amplify the potency of Mercury’s most glorious performance. It felt as though having been allotted his finite portion of life, he had spent it in lavish, outrageous bursts, sharing delightedly with that crowd on July 13, 1985.

Since then, I have watched the set many times, its exuberance and energy undiminished over the 23 years since that first viewing. This is a far from exhaustive account of why, for me, it remains magical.

Queen didn’t open or close the Live Aid show. They performed just before 7pm, uncharacteristically in daylight, bookended by gigantic acts like U2, Elton John and David Bowie.

Past their peak and reeling from the catastrophe of a misadvised run of shows in apartheid South Africa the previous year, Queen was not expected to shine. Mercury, in particular, had been the focus of disparaging coverage and rumors in the press, where speculation over his sexuality had arguably choked the band’s attempts to break into the American market.

Amid an atmosphere charged with pessimism, Mercury danced out on stage and welcomed the crowd like his dearest friend. By the time he sat down at the piano and hit the first few notes of “Bohemian Rhapsody,” he was the absolute master of the stadium.

Over the next 21 minutes, his audience, and the 1.9 billion people watching on TV around the world, fell in love with him. His humor, his hyper-masculine yet fantastically camp energy and that phenomenal four octave voice were irresistible.

During the Live Aid show, Queen played many of its greatest hits. (LFI/Avalon/ZUMA Press)

Mercury was a brilliant sight. He had stripped his look to the bare essentials — white tight jeans, trademark moustache, a white tank top showing off his chest and arms, a studded band hugging his right bicep. The whole group, absent their flamboyant 1970s costumes and set paraphernalia, proved they didn’t need them. There was no distraction from the performance.

Brian May, Roger Taylor and John Deacon, his fellow bandmates, executed their role — that of Mercury’s foil — magnanimously. As a modest May mused years later: “The rest of us played okay, but Freddie was out there and took it to another level.”

Mercury was indeed a born ringmaster. There was no alienating affectation, no wallowing in sentiment. Where other bands might have been complacent, Queen swept through a distilled serving of their greatest and most bombastic hits to date, well-rehearsed over several days beforehand, with a swagger that never milked anything at the expense of the audience.

The only pause came at the end of “Radio Ga Ga,” which Mercury performed at the edge of the stage, pumping his sawn-off mic at the crowd. For just over 30 seconds, he led them in a vocal improvisation, which was later christened “the note heard around the world.” He carried the audience, his winks and nods making the triumph a shared one, blown kisses and thrusting hips an assurance that he was as turned on by everyone as everyone was by him.

Queen consciously wrote their songs as vehicles for theatrics, and that day, it set them apart. They closed their set with “We Are The Champions,” an anthem built to amplify with the size of its audience. Mercury, having flown across the stage for the entire show, returned to the piano for the start of the song, echoing the set’s opening, but then came back to the crowd for the climax. He took nothing for granted, his remarkable vocals flawless till the end, even as he basked in his indisputable victory at the edge of the stage.

The brilliance of that set didn’t only reverberate around the world that summer. It has rippled through every viewing thereafter. For a man whose death is so focal in the history of HIV/AIDS, Mercury remains undefined by it. He greeted the world on his own terms and did whatever he loved, as and when he chose to. His spectacular performance at Live Aid, which not only resurrected Queen, but established them as one of the most successful acts of all time, is just one part of his generous legacy. It deserves to be enjoyed for many years yet. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Story highlights A judge recently ruled in favor of Maine truckers because of a missing Oxford comma

John McWhorter: Oxford commas ward off ambiguity, but need not be used all the time

John McWhorter teaches linguistics, American studies, philosophy and music history at Columbia University and is the author of "Words on the Move." The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

(CNN) A recent court case seems like a victory for fans of the grand old Oxford comma. To many, it feels natural to write "Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and Cleveland." But just as one may feel lazy saying "My brother and me went home" rather than "My brother and I," there is a sense that it is more proper to write "Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, and Cleveland," inserting a comma after the item before the last one.

And people advocating for the Oxford comma have a point now and then. If you were a trucker reading that union rules deny you overtime pay for "the canning, processing, preserving, freezing, drying, marketing, storing, packing for shipment or distribution of agricultural produce," would you consider yourself due overtime payment nevertheless for distribution? That is, as opposed to packing things for shipping and distribution?

John McWhorter

Truckers for Oakhurst Dairy in Maine have been granted back overtime pay for having distributed product as opposed to packing it, because though the writers of the contract meant that overtime would not be granted for distribution either, this is not clear when there is no comma after shipment. The drivers' lawyer has successfully argued that the contract appears to stipulate that overtime won't be granted for, only, the packing of things for future shipping and distribution.

But it's premature to read this as demonstrating that everybody should always use the Oxford comma. What happened here shows, just as defensibly, that the Oxford comma should be used in cases of potential ambiguity. The people who wrote the union contract made a mistake, but not in way that means all of us should feel bad about writing "hamburgers, hot dogs and French fries."

We might feel slovenly, however, for writing "I had toast, bacon and eggs and coffee" where one could argue that it's unclear whether the bacon and eggs went together or eggs and coffee did, or "My parents, Mother Teresa and the Pope," which implies a rather stunning parental history in casting those two people as your parents, as opposed to persons in sequence with your parents.

Christine M. says that her stepfather canceled his plane ticket to her wedding in Utah because of their political differences (she’s anti-President Donald Trump, he’s pro). Justin M. won’t wear his MAGA hat in his hometown of Boston for fear he’ll be humiliated. Richard G., an independent who lives in the Tampa area, put a “No Politics Zone” sign on his door after several Trump-supporting coworkers challenged him over the latest political headlines.

Mario Benavente, a North Carolina Republican, puts it simply: “Political debate right now is a blood sport.”

These folks are only a snapshot of the reality facing Americans today. Many parents no longer want their children marrying people from a different political party — 35% of Republicans and 45% of Democrats, to be precise. Workers, like Richard, feel politics simply has no place in the office. And Americans at large dread the idea of Thanksgiving dinners with family members who might bring up President Donald Trump. Some on the right are even concerned we are on the verge of a new Civil War.

“Political debate right now is a blood sport.” – Mario Benavente, a North Carolina Republican

In 2019, there’s only one thing that unites us: just how divided we think we are. In fact, according to the Public Religion Research Institute, 91% of Americans feel we are polarized — and 74% feel we are extremely polarized.

Welcome to the Fractured States of America. In this series, over the next three weeks, we’ll explore the new landscape of a polarized America and examine ways to get beyond it, with the help of frequent CNN Opinion contributors and many new voices, including those of our readers.

The harm it’s causing

Politics is now a major source of stress for Americans. According to Pew Research Center, almost 50% of Republicans and nearly 60% of Democrats say discussing partisan issues — be they abortion, immigration or gun control — can be “stressful and frustrating.” And increased levels of stress are often linked to increased risks of chest pain, headache and sleeping problems. Not surprisingly, then, many Americans have also reported losing sleep and experiencing bouts of depression because of political tensions.

But it gets worse. Political division increases the risk of violence. As people begin to identify with one party or another, they isolate themselves and can become more extreme in their views. According to data from two national surveys, 15% of self-identifying Republicans and 20% of self-identifying Democrats think the country would be better if members of the opposing party “just died.” And almost 10% of people who identify as members of both major parties think violence would be acceptable if the opposing party’s candidate won the next presidential election. While these individuals represent a minority of surveyed participants, the fact that any voters are thinking in these terms is cause for alarm.

We’ve been here before

Of course, this is not the first time this country has experienced political division. At the founding of the United States, America’s first president, George Washington, warned of the dangers of partisanship — stating in his Farewell Address, “It agitates the community with ill-founded jealousies and … foments occasionally riot and insurrection.”

Watch: John Avlon on the problem with polarization

And his fears came to a frightening reality less than 100 years later when the issue of slavery led to the outbreak of the Civil War. The US lost 750,000 lives in that war, or approximately 2% of its population. But the end of the war in 1865 did not spell a unified vision for the future.

From the Great Depression to the Vietnam War, the 20th century was marked by periods of division over economic inequality, political ideology and the use of military force. However, as documentary filmmaker Ken Burns explains to CNN, “the essential thing about history, though it catalogs so many injustices and indignities, is that it always shows us that particularly the American example moves back to the center.”

For now, though, the pendulum appears to have swung toward the extremes.

How we got here

Just pause for a moment and think about the town or city you call home. How many of your neighbors voted the same way you did in the last presidential election cycle? Probably most of them. And if they didn’t, research indicates you may be considering relocating sometime soon.

Just 40 years ago, most districts in the US were swing districts. Today, less than half of them are. And this is unlikely to change anytime soon, as more and more people move to neighborhoods where they likely won’t encounter anyone who holds an opposing political view.

So, what happened over the last four decades? Journalist Bill Bishop explains we’ve been self-sorting ourselves since the 1970s, when geographic inequality in education grew. That meant Americans with college degrees began clustering in big cities, while less-educated people remained in more rural areas. And jobs migrated accordingly, with technology and production following the new city dwellers.

This clustering was followed by the rise of partisan media, social media networks and a market that was built quite literally on catering to those divisions. In other words, entire identities — defined by diet, media patterns and size of home — have been created around party affiliation. And, as sociological research explains, place, and even consumption habits, have become a way of creating identity and broadcasting it to the world — or, at least, our closest neighbor.

The dangers of self-sorting

There is an inherent danger in this form of identity politicking — it’s isolating and pushes people into their respective political tribes. In these tribes, they are not forced to rigorously interrogate their belief systems.

Identifying with our tribes isn’t inherently bad, notes SE Cupp. “Tribalism, after all, is part of our evolutionary DNA. The need to identify with a group, to belong and commune with like-minded people is not only biological, it’s what has helped motivate our desire for and devotion to all kinds of important cultural institutions, from organized religion to sports fandom.”

What isn’t natural, she says, is the increased importance we attach to politics, or the rigid allegiance to a specific political tribe — and the misperceptions of the other side that accompany it.

“Tribalism, after all, is part of our evolutionary DNA.” – SE Cupp, host of “SE Cupp Unfiltered”

So much of our division, or our perceived level of discomfort with the opposing party, is imagined. For many liberals, listening to a Ted Cruz speech is seen as nails on a chalkboard, or slightly less painful than a root canal. And for conservatives, the same might be said about Bernie Sanders. Yet Harvard researchers found that the negative anticipation both sides had about these experiences far exceeded the result. When forced to listen to Cruz and Sanders, both groups said it was much more tolerable than they expected.

But it’s hard for liberals, conservatives and even independents — who research suggests usually have partisan leanings — to realize this because they live in their echo chambers, which often reinforce their existing beliefs and make them even more polarized. All of this comes at a cost — creating a massive perception gap between what Americans suspect their political opponents think and what the reality is.

The other cost? Awkward family gatherings — be it for the holidays, weddings or funerals. People feel increasingly uncomfortable around their Fox News-loving grandfather or their New York Times-subscribing granddaughter. And research indicates the solution to this is simply to not engage in political debate. Stick to sports or the weather. But do not mention the White House or its current inhabitant.

But there is some good news

Most Americans are not hyper-partisans. They comprise the “exhausted majority,” writes scholar Daniel Yudkin. They are flexible in their politics and open to compromise — especially if that means advancing legislation on issues like gun reform.

And there may be a way to re-engage them in the political process. Deborah Fallows recommends starting on the local level. While our national government may seem paralyzed most days, towns — big and small — “are often and strongly acting in a united way, facing their problems, negotiating their solutions and taking action for the greater good of their communities,” she says.

The reason is pretty simple. At the local level, people recognize the bucks stop with them — and they cannot wait for someone else to “save” them. If a school is failing, if a bridge is breaking, they are the ones who can move quickest to address the situation.

Ken Burns has another idea — share stories. “We all have stories. And sometimes they lead us back to emotions and feelings we have in common,” he explains. That may require breaking out of our red and blue silos and actually grabbing beers (Coors is the preferred drink of both parties!) with someone of a different political persuasion.

But it also involves having a frank discussion of what our core American values are.

“We all have stories. And sometimes they lead us back to emotions and feelings we have in common.” – Ken Burns, American filmmaker

What are our core values

At the “Looking For America” dinner organized by New American Economy, American University School of Public Affairs and Curiosity Connects at the El Paso Museum of History, guests were asked to bring an item that illustrates their connection to their community.

Andrea Beltran, a liberal leaning writer and poet, shared her great-grandmother's 1920 nonresident alien border crossing card, containing the only photo Beltran has of the family matriarch. She explained that the card represents the idea of identity “being something hard to locate and even harder to define.” In this climate of what she calls “heavy patriotism and nationalism,” her great-grandmother reminds her just how complicated, and perhaps even dangerous, it can be to define who is and who is not American simply on the basis of birth.

John Moye, a moderate Republican and development manager for the Housing Authority, brought a 1944 El Paso Times newspaper article, which recounted his father’s experience as a prisoner of war in then-Nazi Germany. His father, who enlisted in the military the day after Pearl Harbor, survived 10 months as a POW before eventually returning to Texas. Moye emphasized that the article shows how much people at the height of World War II "truly gave of themselves and asked for little in return," a kind of patriotism he worries Americans are now losing.

Though Beltran and Moye are lifelong El Pasoans with strong connections to the city they call home, their items of choice reflect their different perspectives on this country’s fundamental values. Beltran chose the nonresident card to emphasize the complexity, but also beauty of American identity. It’s not singular — it’s messy, multilingual and built on the backs of immigrants. And trying to narrowly define it hurts us as a nation.

Moye used the newspaper clipping to showcase the importance of having a clear national identity and parlaying that into sacrifice for one’s country. His choice reflects a nostalgia for a different time, and perhaps even generation, when duty to country came first. Back then, Americans were united around a common cause — and had a strong sense of community. These days, for so many, both cause and community hang in the balance, he says.

Beltran and Moye’s differences on what American national identity should or could be is just one example of the fractured state of America. But their ability to break bread together also offers a ray of hope — one that is premised on the notion that the US is stronger because of its diversity of views, rather than its uniform acceptance of any one ideology.

As Beltran phrased it, “the best thing about this dinner was it reminded me of the human connection.” Moye seconded her, noting that though he disagreed with some of Beltran’s views, he was so grateful “that a space was finally created for these kinds of tough conversations. This country needs more of them.” <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) If you want to understand how American politics has become more polarized and extreme over the last decade, look no farther than Asheville, North Carolina -- now split between two of the most gerrymandered districts in the country.

Artists, independent spirits and environmentalists have traditionally flocked to this hippie enclave, surrounded by conservative hill towns, for the majestic Blue Ridge Mountains, thriving local brewpubs, vegan cafes and independent bookstores.

And, a decade ago, North Carolina's 11th congressional district, with Asheville at its heart, was among the nation's most competitive, see-sawing with shifting political winds. It favored Republicans during the two elections that followed the September 11 attacks, then veered toward Democrats beginning in 2006 as the Iraq war stagnated and stock market tumbled.

This district does not swing any longer. Asheville is now represented by two of the most conservative members of Congress , including the outgoing chairman of the House Freedom Caucus, who have won their races since 2012 by double-digit averages

Why? Because while the old map preserved Asheville in one competitive district, the new one sliced the city in half, scattering its voters across two districts in a way that ensured a Republican captured both seats.

But when the 11th district switched from a toss-up to safely Republican, the entire political dynamic changed. Without a competitive general election, the real action moved to the GOP primary, where turnout tends to be lower, and limited to the activist base. Only the most ideological extreme candidates stood a chance.

Not surprisingly, many locals are unhappy with this reality. "The majority of the electorate in Asheville feels that their views are not represented in Congress," Mayor Esther Manheimer said in March . The matter is not settled; judges recently blocked the congressional map from being used in 2020 elections.

Of course, this story is not unique to Asheville. All over the country, partisans have cracked cities in two, drawn districts that look like Donald Duck kicking Goofy and exploited new technology and advanced data to maximize gains.

And the consequences for democracy continue to be catastrophic, locking in a new era of minority rule across multiple states, distorting the competitive balance of congressional delegations and placing public policy -- and many politicians -- beyond the reach of the ballot box.

But which came first: the extreme gerrymanders or the heightened polarization? The reality is that each acts as an accelerant on the other, exacerbating a situation these politicians candidly describe in amicus briefs before the US Supreme Court as a Montague vs. Capulet-styled Shakespearean bloodbath.

Gerrymandered districts have also helped create an epidemic of minority rule nationwide, driving state politics to extremes not supported by voters who find themselves unable to do anything about it.

Almost 60 million Americans live in a state where one or both chambers of legislature is controlled by the party that won fewer statewide votes in the 2018 election. A new study finds that with fair lines, 59 congressional seats would have changed hands in 2012, 2014 and 2016. (Republicans gained 39 seats they would not have won; Democrats secured 20.)

Of course, gerrymandering has been part of our politics from the start . The bad news for democracy is that we're better at gerrymandering than ever before. Powerful computers , sophisticated mapping software and terabytes of voter, census and consumer data -- alongside growing polarization -- make it possible to draw surgical district lines that provide sturdy bulwarks against electoral waves and maximize partisan advantage across an entire state.

It's more than geography: Multiple academic studies, involving tens of thousands of neutral maps, consistently show that the partisan-drawn maps in the most gerrymandered states are radical outliers.

Neither political party has more historical virtue when it comes to gerrymandering, but GOP strategists outplayed their DNC counterparts ahead of the 2010 election, recognizing that redistricting provided a path back to power after the party's 2008 walloping at the hands of President Barack Obama.

In fact, the GOP invested $30 million into state legislative races in closely divided states like Ohio, Wisconsin and North Carolina, seeking to win full control of congressional and state legislative maps. The lines Republicans drew the following year stuck.

It was a political masterstroke: Every 10 years, following the census, congressional lines are redrawn to account for population changes. In most states, the state legislature takes the lead, so the GOP's modest investment paid handsome dividends. (As a result, Democrats controlled the process in fewer states than Republicans, so they lacked the same opportunities to gerrymander in 2010. They did take full advantage of their biggest opportunity, drawing a map that pushed their advantage in Maryland all the way to 7-1.)

But most Americans vote in uncompetitive districts, where the outcome is pre-ordained and reflective of only the most partisan extremes. Uncompetitive districts elect a different kind of politician, who is then incentivized to cater only to their base.

Missouri, It doesn't have to be this way. Americans hate gerrymandering and believe in fair elections, evident by the various initiatives and constitutional amendments that passed in 2018, including successful efforts to stop politicians from drawing their own districts and choosing their own voters in Michigan Colorado, Ohio and Utah

Many of our national divisions are real and difficult to bridge. Gerrymandering, however, is self-inflicted. We've done this to ourselves -- but we can undo it, too. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) In this era of extreme political division, one issue is bringing people together: the need to invest in public safety solutions that reduce crime and make the criminal justice system fairer.

For the first time in my life, it appears every presidential candidate is running as a champion of criminal justice reform -- including (to the shock of many) Donald J. Trump . It is an astonishing reversal in both political parties. For decades, ambitious politicians tried to outdo each other with "lock 'em up" policies and "tough-on-crime" rhetoric.

This dynamic accelerated after George H.W. Bush crushed Massachusetts Democrat Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential race. Popular wisdom attributed the win to television ads spotlighting a prisoner named Willie Horton , who committed heinous crimes while part of Dukakis' prison furlough program. Afterward, generations of politicians were afraid to champion prison reform.

So, how did justice reform emerge as the one cause that brings people together? The answers are complicated -- and surprising.

I have a special perspective on the topic. In California, the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights , which I co-founded in 1996, helped to close five abusive youth prisons; we also blocked construction of a draconian "super jail for youth" near Oakland. Five years ago, I co-founded the Dream Corps' #cut50 campaign with Jessica Jackson and Matt Haney, through which we passed more than a dozen bipartisan criminal justice bills at the state level, plus last year's federal First Step Act . This year, I helped launch the REFORM Alliance , which aims to shrink and transform the probation and parole systems.

I have dedicated my life to this cause. But I have never seen anything like 2019 -- a year in which all presidential candidates and both parties are fighting over who can be trusted to put fewer people behind bars while reducing crime.

The magic moment

Any shift of this magnitude has many causes. Let's explore the top five:

1. The trifecta

Finally, lawmakers eventually got frustrated investing billions into a system that was failing to rehabilitate a majority of people who came into contact with it. Incarceration fatigue opened the door to new ways of thinking about crime prevention that address underlying causes -- like mental health, drugs, trauma, etc. And so leaders began shifting resources to create specialty courts -- veterans courts, drug courts, mental health courts -- across the country.

2. Culture shift

The television series, "Orange is the New Black," brought binge-watching Americans inside the lives of women living behind bars. Ava DuVernay's explosive documentary, "The 13th," and Netflix series, "When They See Us," broke hearts. Other documentaries and podcasts, from "Time: The Kalief Browder Story" to "Serial," opened the public's eyes

Authors like Michelle Alexander and Bryan Stevenson shook the consciences of those who read their works. Shaka Senghor's bestselling book, "Writing My Wrongs," won the admiration of Oprah Winfrey and helped to open the floodgates for formerly incarcerated authors. And in recent years, household names like Common, John Legend, Alicia Keys and Kim Kardashian have become outspoken advocates.

This wave of popular media pushed into mainstream living rooms and reached beyond the pool of those who once paid attention to the incarceration system. It is now common knowledge that the United States, shamefully, has the highest incarceration rate in the world.

3. Democratic value: Justice

Many people assume that Democrats always opposed mass incarceration. That is a myth. Democrats overwhelmingly backed President Bill Clinton's disastrous 1994 crime bill. The deep blue state of California just recently began to dig itself out of an incarceration crisis that resulted in the construction of more than 20 prisons but only one university in the past generation. And the national Democratic Party's platform carefully excluded any reference to criminal justice reform until 2016

So, what changed? Many things -- from #BlackLivesMatter to the opioid crisis

Seeing African American communities devastated by decades of overpolicing and excessive incarceration, a new generation of black activists rebelled. Starting in 2013, they demanded that Democrats address head-on the issues of racist police abuse and racial bias in the justice system. Their passion gave more political room for traditional civil rights and civil liberties organizations to accelerate their own longstanding reform efforts.

Pushed past the breaking point, the incarceration generation rose up and insisted that Democrats speak out boldly against the racial injustice in the system. Today, all Democrats echo their call. The protests that started in 2013 have yielded a Democratic Party today that is more firmly grounded in its core ideals of racial, gender and social justice.

But Democrats also know the Republicans aren't going to "Willie Horton" them, since so many conservatives are also embracing the cause.

4. Republican value: Liberty

their own Many on the left doubt the sincerity of criminal justice reformers on the right. They can't believe that Republicans would truly care about a "racial justice" issue. But the truth is that Republicans have reasons to oppose the incarceration industry.

Republicans care a lot about public safety. But the "tough on crime" system made many communities less safe . Today, many conservatives want an evidence-based system that focuses on reducing crime. They've returned to principles that resonate deeply on the right as they joined the fight for reform.

Another conservative principle is the desire for transparency, accountability and limits on government overreach. Libertarians especially don't want the government to have too much power over individual lives. The Koch brothers fall into this category. So do US Sens. Mike Lee and Rand Paul and advocacy groups like FreedomWorks.

Yet another conservative value is the faith-based belief in human dignity. Religious conservatives, including Newt Gingrich, worry the present system leaves no real opportunity for second chances or personal redemption. When he was the Republican governor of Mississippi, Phil Bryant explicitly cited his Christian faith as the source of his passion for prison reform

Black pro-Trump conservatives like Candace Owens and Katrina Pierson are working to return a pro-Lincoln, pro-freedom ethic inside the GOP on this issue.

5. The Trump factor

Then there is the most surprising plot twist of all: Trump's decision to release Alice Johnson . The world watched as Johnson, a 63-year-old grandmother who had been sentenced to die in prison, ran across the road into her family's arms. We began to hear the President shift from describing himself as "tough on crime" to expressing that he's tough but fair and recognizing the disproportionate sentencing in the justice system. Surrounded by law enforcement, faith leaders, Republican members and even several Democrats, Trump then endorsed adding sentencing reform to the First Step Act, which he signed into law later that year.

Because many red state governors took the lead , this Republican President could engage on criminal justice reform without risking his base. More importantly, key people in Trump's inner circle -- including his son-in-law, Jared Kushner -- were strong allies. This opened the door for formerly incarcerated people (on the left and right) to make repeated visits to the White House, sharing their experiences with senior officials of how the existing system failed them.

People on both sides of the aisle should be glad that Trump decided to adopt the cause -- and not crush it. Criminal justice reform could have fallen into a divisive stalemate like guns, climate or immigration. Instead, Trump's decision to embrace criminal justice reform has set Republicans free to work with Democrats. That's a good thing for both parties -- and a very good thing for the people suffering behind bars.

Lessons beyond criminal justice

I've spent time in red states, blue states, Appalachia and urban neighborhoods. I see the same problems everywhere: generational poverty, addiction, underperforming schools, lack of access to mental health services and a broken criminal justice system. Neither party has been able to make a real dent in these problems facing low-income communities.

The sad truth is that Republicans get a lot of votes from poor, rural communities -- but have failed to sufficiently improve conditions or expand opportunity there. Democrats get a lot of votes from poor, urban communities -- but we have failed to sufficiently improve conditions or expand opportunity there. That's why I came to believe in bottom-up bipartisanship -- centered on addressing the pain of the people at the bottom in both parties.

However, here is what I know: Change is possible -- and criminal justice reform is evidence of that. As recently as 2014, the idea of "bipartisan criminal justice reform" was an oxymoron. Now it is almost a cliché. And, symbolically, Alice Johnson has replaced Willie Horton as the iconic image of a formerly incarcerated person.

When I started 25 years ago, politicians in both parties promised to lock up more people, treat them more harshly and keep them behind bars longer. Today, leaders in both parties say we should lock up fewer people, help them transform their lives and send them home better, not bitter.

Criminal justice reform is renewing the right's dedication to individual "liberty" and deepening the left's commitment to social "justice." As a result, we still have a chance to build a country with "liberty" and "justice" for all. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) I am a political activist by nature. In my home country of Brazil, I helped organize peaceful protests against government corruption and abuses of power. At the time -- way back in 2013 -- Brazil was plagued by scandal, with much of the population living in poverty. And yet the country's politicians, the source of so much of the scandal, continued to push agendas that benefited themselves and few others.

Julia Song

But with excessive spending on the World Cup draining the country's already depleted resources, I was able to find a path forward with Brazilians from across the political spectrum. Our collective protests helped lead to a government investigation into corruption. Ultimately, many politicians went to prison , and the country's president -- Dilma Rousseff -- was impeached

Shortly after the protests, I moved to the United States on a family visa, where I was granted temporary residency, allowing me the right to work. I then began a four-year-long process to gain full citizenship, navigating the complexities and the financial costs of the American immigration bureaucracy.

Arriving to this new country, I thought that my activism days were behind me. But then I noticed a growing political divide between the elites, or establishment politicians, and working-class Americans just trying to get by. Sensing the disconnect -- and the growing power of the political elite -- I began using the power of social media to raise awareness of the issue, first on Instagram, and then on Twitter.

I advocated for my belief in a smaller government that guarantees more individual freedoms -- and allows everyday Americans a chance at success. If you haven't guessed yet, I'm a Republican, and I support President Donald Trump's emphasis on fighting for ordinary Americans.

SE Cupp is a CNN political commentator and the host of " SE Cupp Unfiltered ." The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers. View more opinion articles on CNN.

(CNN) In an NBC/WSJ poll earlier this year, only 1 in 10 adults agreed that the two-party system in this country was working fairly well.

This means that both parties are leaving a lot to be desired, according to voters, and many are coming to see the radical need for an alternative. In fact, 38% of respondents said the country needs a third party, the highest number who have said so since this poll began tracking the question in 1995.

And a third party that makes it its raison d'etre to represent the rest of the electorate might get a good look by voters in this environment.

Contributing to the need for an alternative party is the feeling that politics is dividing us up -- and leaving a lot of us out. And the choices we're usually left with, Republican or Democrat, aren't good enough.

The immigration disconnect

Just take this example from one of the early Democratic primary debates in June, when candidates were asked whether they supported decriminalizing our borders --that is, repealing Section 1325 of Title 8 of the US Code, which makes crossing the border without official inspection a misdemeanor offense.

As of an August tally by Politico, 14 Democratic candidates, some of whom are no longer in the running, had supported decriminalizing the border. For many progressive voters, the idea likely seemed necessary. After all, President Donald Trump was using the statute to detain and separate asylum-seeking families at the border.

Dem Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez tweeted : "Border policy: As @JulianCastro mentioned in the #DemDebate, it's time to repeal Section 1325 & 1326, the statutes this admin is using to mindlessly throw people in cages. We have to take these proceedings out of criminal code and into civil code. Torture accomplishes nothing."

What made the moment astonishing for anyone remotely in touch with voters -- or who had read recent polls -- was that this idea was far outside the mainstream. What many saw as simply ending the mechanism to determine whether immigration was legal or illegal is not popular.

According to an NPR/PBS News Hour/Marist poll among registered voters conducted shortly after that debate, decriminalizing the border enjoyed a paltry 27% of support.

But this was a Democratic primary -- the candidates were at least speaking to their base, right?

No. Only 45% of Democrats thought decriminalizing the border a good idea, versus 47% who didn't. When broken down even further, only 34% of moderate Democrats supported it, while 58% did not. And those coveted independent voters? Only 24% of them were on board.

Here was a policy proposal supported wholly by at least 14 Democratic candidates for president, and in some part by others, that had been resoundingly rejected by the majority of America, and also the majority of their own voters.

What was going on here? What were Democrats thinking?

The politics of extremes

This is emblematic of our new politics of extremes. In recent years, ultra-progressive voices on the left and only the Trumpiest of positions on the right seem to be winning out, while more moderate voices in both parties are going extinct.

On the right, just look at the fates of Jeff Flake, an Arizona Republican Senator forced into early retirement for his pushback against Trump, or Charlie Dent, a Pennsylvania Republican congressman whose centrist views within his party prompted him to resign before finishing his term, leaving his seat vacant. (Dent is now a CNN political commentator). And the pileup of Republican retirements grow almost by the day.

Over on the left, there is some unity in common cause against Trump, but Democrats are also eating their own. Ocasio-Cortez pushed her Queens predecessor, former Rep. Joe Crowley, out after 20 years in that seat. Voices like those in "the Squad" -- Ocasio-Cortez, Rep. Ilhan Omar, Rep. Rashida Tlaib and Rep. Ayanna Pressley -- get far more attention than their moderate counterparts.

A so-called " alterna-squad ," a group of moderate Democratic congresswomen including Rep. Abigail Spanberger, Rep. Mikie Sherrill, Rep. Elissa Slotkin and Rep. Chrissy Houlahan, has far less recognizable names. Unlike Ocasio-Cortez, none, for example, has been on "Jimmy Kimmel Live!"

Meanwhile, as Democrats and Republicans swing for the extremes, millions and millions of Americans are left without real representation. The 2020 primary is elucidating that. A line I've heard over and over again from moderates and independents after a Democratic debate is something to the effect of, "Well I can't vote for Trump, but I'm not with those guys, either."

In preferring to quadruple down on their most ardent base supporters, the parties are missing a wide swath of voters in the middle who are turned off by both the style and the substance of their increasingly absolutist proposals and their insistence that "finding common ground" is for wimps and traitors. (Just ask Democratic presidential contender Joe Biden how well it went over when he called Vice President Mike Pence "a decent guy.")

Despite the rancor and fire-breathing on both sides, most voters are somewhere in the middle on any host of issues, even the most "divisive."

The silent middle majority

Take abortion. "[M]ore than half of US adults take a non-absolutist position," according to Pew . Only 12% of voters say abortion should be illegal in all cases, and 27% say it should be legal in all cases. The rest of us -- the majority -- agree it should be legal but with restrictions.

Gun control is another issue in which the majority often goes unrepresented.

A number of gun control proposals enjoy wide bipartisan support, even among Republican voters. Polls show 72% support requiring background checks for private gun sales. And yet, the majority of Republican lawmakers refuse to even consider that widely popular measure. Shouldn't those voters feel betrayed by that?

Immigration, though, perhaps best encapsulates the political parties' willingness to ignore majority opinions, even inside their own parties.

While Democrats are clear on wanting a pathway to citizenship for Dreamers and other undocumented immigrants, and Republicans frequently say that they don't , what neither seem to get is where they share common ground.

Believe it or not, a majority of Republicans (54%) believe there should be a way for undocumented immigrants to stay in this country legally -- a path to legal status -- if they meet some requirements over time.

And as it turns out, that's what undocumented immigrants seem to prioritize as well. If we're to believe the naturalization rates following former President Ronald Reagan's 1986 amnesty bill, by 2009 only about 41% of those legalized had become American citizens. More than citizenship, many immigrants want to be able to come out of the shadows and work here legally.

So why are we arguing over citizenship instead of passing legal-status legislation, which enjoys majority support and even Republican support?

Legislative solutions aren't profitable

Here's the easy answer to that and other head-scratching questions about who is actually representing us: Solving problems isn't as politically profitable as keeping them broken.

Whether on immigration or gun crime, health care or climate, the two parties thrive when these issues remain broken. Democrats can fundraise off and run against xenophobic, gun-crazy, poor-hating, gas-guzzling Republicans, and Republicans do the same against open-border, gun-banning, wealth-redistributing, coal-killing Democrats.

Meanwhile, a majority of voters are left hanging with unsolved problems, somewhere in the middle of this never-ending scrum.

As much as it seems like Republican voters just want to "own the Libs," and Democratic voters are happy being "the resistance," it might surprise you to know that there are plenty who actually want cooperation between the parties.

Just after the 2018 midterm elections, in which Democrats took back the House, a full 46% of Democratic voters said they thought Democratic leaders in Congress should cooperate a great deal or a fair amount with Trump over the next two years.

Even more astonishingly, 77% of Republicans said Trump should cooperate with Democratic leaders in Congress.

All of which is to say that neither party seems all that concerned with where voters in the middle are on policy or tone. That's likely only going to get worse.

A party by the middle and for the middle

A third party could fill this void. This party wouldn't be ideological in nature, as those already exist. It wouldn't take this position or that one, and it wouldn't have a charter or a platform committing to a fixed value set. Its only commitment would be to represent and support the majority of moderates and independents on every issue, wherever they are.

For example, right now independents represent 38% of the electorate, including those who say they lean Democrat or lean Republican -- a.k.a. moderates. According to Pew , a third party representing these voters right now would support gay marriage and legalizing marijuana, it would oppose building a wall along the US-Mexico border and oppose increasing tariffs between the US and trading partners, and it believes that some government regulation is necessary to protect public interest and that a smaller government providing fewer services is best.

That third party would also lean pro-abortion -- keeping Roe v. Wade in place -- but would add some restrictions as to when and under what circumstances abortions should be given.

It supports stricter gun laws, background checks on all gun purchases and a ban on assault weapons. It doesn't, however, support a mandatory assault weapon buy back, and it believes mental illness is a bigger cause of mass shootings than the availability of guns.

It would support raising taxes on companies that burn fossil fuels and believes human activity is causing the climate to change.

In other words, it would represent the unaffiliated middle that isn't on either extreme. There wouldn't be any litmus or purity tests. It would support and run candidates who pledge to represent the middle, and not chase either party as they move further and further to the fringes. The party wouldn't have to contort itself to defend its leadership, because it would be driven by voters themselves.

One of the benefits of this sort of party is that it can't, by definition, attract demagogues, cult figures or egomaniacs. Campaigns are framed around voter polling, not personality or promises of pie-in-the-sky change that only a few are demanding. The only promise is to listen to you and legislate accordingly.

Naturally, the biggest hurdle to a viable third party is the parties themselves. Both hold enormous influence over the presidential elections, from managing donor lists to unleashing get-out-the-vote apparatus.

There's also the debates. Since the 1987 Commission on Presidential Debates was formed, both parties have fought to keep third-party interlopers out of the televised events. Ross Perot only won his place on the 1992 debate stage because both George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton demanded he be allowed to participate, both thinking they would benefit.

So long as the parties control the means of production, so to speak, third-party candidates will be seriously disadvantaged.

Finally, whether an alternative party in today's age of personality politics is realistic is a question for another essay. But just imagining a third party that isn't swayed by cable news hosts, preening politicians, special interests, that isn't designed solely to enrich coffers and play to an ever-shrinking base, but exists simply to reflect the moderate majority lowers one's blood pressure almost instantly.

Because let's face it: the two-party system, in all its absolutisms, is leaving many of us without representation. And if America's future is in the hands of these two parties alone for much longer, we'll all be politically homeless eventually. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) America is self-segregating into separate political realities. And partisan media is driving much of this division across new platforms, polarizing for profit while amplifying extreme voices and achieving unprecedented reach -- including the Oval Office.

President Donald Trump is a creature of partisan media, having kicked off his political career with regular appearances on Fox News. His obsessive consumption causes him to echo its talking points , often overriding information from US intelligence agencies. This leaves him susceptible to conspiracy theories that have now led to the fourth impeachment inquiry in our history.

We've always had partisan media in America, with Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson slashing each other in the pages of competing broadsheets on the same street in Philadelphia.

What we're dealing with today is different because of the pervasive scale of partisan media and its dissemination alongside disinformation. Its proliferation has been hastened by the rise of a partisan economy amid a fragmented media market, aiming to keep a narrow but intense niche audience addicted to anger, anxiety and resentment. But this is a Faustian bargain, because it requires going to ever-increasing extremes to keep the audience engaged while constantly attacking the credibility of nonpartisan news organizations.

The rise of social media has balkanized us further , amplifying the loudest voices, often manipulating perceptions of public opinion via anonymous bots and trolls, while driving many reasonable people from the public square of civic debate. These disinformation deployments often shape the tone of partisan media while exploiting the lack of trust it has helped create.

The result is real: A new Pew Survey shows that 73% of Americans now believe that Republicans and Democrats cannot agree on basic facts. That's a potential death sentence for a democracy that depends on reasoning together to solve common problems.

This is also an unhealthy departure from our best traditions. We had partisan newspapers in the past that, for example, excoriated and defended the New Deal, but there was still a general baseline commitment to facts and a clear delineation between news and editorial opinion. On the broadcast side, the fairness doctrine, introduced in 1949, was a condition of leasing federal airwaves that aimed to ensure balance by requiring time for opposing political views.

That doesn't mean there were not deep disagreements and bitter debate.

The Joe McCarthy test

America was tested by the rise of Sen. Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin, a conservative, populist anti-communist with a demagogue's disregard for facts. While accusing Democrats of treason, McCarthy often tried to play the victim of the liberal elite media , equating The Washington Post with the communist Daily Worker -- while in fact old-line Republican papers like the Chicago Tribune and New York Herald Tribune were also warning about McCarthy's tactics.

McCarthy's rise on the back of wild accusations caused some editors to question whether the traditional approach of simply reporting what a public official said was consistent with the larger responsibility of telling the truth. But McCarthy met his match in Edward R. Murrow, the legendary CBS broadcast news pioneer, who took on McCarthy by fact-checking his public statements, closing his show in March 1954 by saying , "We must not confuse dissent with disloyalty. ... We will not be driven by fear into an age of unreason."

But Murrow vs. McCarthy was a notable exception in a post-war period. Despite the stickiness of who was determining what was fair and balanced, the fairness doctrine proved surprisingly popular among conservatives and liberals who believed it ensured a degree of "public interest" programming. When it was overturned by the Federal Communications Commission in 1987, the Senate voted 59-31 to reinstate it on bipartisan lines -- but it was vetoed by former President Ronald Reagan.

This is when partisan media as we know it began to proliferate.

From the fairness doctrine to Fox News

One study by former chief economist at the FCC Thomas Winslow Hazlett, recounted in his book " The Political Spectrum ," found that talk radio took off after the fairness doctrine was dismantled, displacing what had been the most popular radio format: music. Our country got more polarized as partisan opinion became big business, untethered from any obligation to be fair and balanced.

This was the moment Roger Ailes had been waiting for. A one-time talk show producer-turned-political consultant, Ailes pushed a political strategy called "positive polarization" in Richard Nixon's 1968 presidential campaign. While Nixon repeated "the press is the enemy" like a mantra, Ailes envisioned the creation of a conservative news network that could counteract major newspapers and the big three networks.

Ailes had the opportunity to operationalize his partisan dream with the launch of Fox News in 1996. Extending the popularity of right-wing talk radio into cable news, the idea was simple and sinister: Only explicit bias could balance the implicit bias of the mainstream media. But in a breathtaking bit of cynicism, this partisan project would be sold as " fair and balanced ."

Later that same year, MSNBC launched and evolved into a liberal counterweight. The partisan media arms race was on. But what is good for ratings can be bad for the country.

Partisan media and the decline of trust

The impact was clear: Just over a decade later, a Pew Survey on media credibility found that "virtually every news organization or program has seen its credibility marks decline." Even C-SPAN, which offers unedited coverage of public events, experienced a steep decline in believability. In this hyper-partisan environment, people literally weren't trusting what they see with their own eyes.

Instead of creating more informed citizens, partisan media compounded tribalism through an echo chamber -- a loose network of blogs, talk radio and partisan cable news that mainstreamed conspiracy theories and increasingly gave talking points to party leaders rather than vice versa.

Then came social media. It promised to break down barriers, but instead of simply being a great leveler, it was quickly hijacked by operatives who realized that it was also the greatest vehicle for disinformation ever devised.

The Trump effect

All these dynamics contributed to the rise of Donald Trump to the presidency. He took his reality television celebrity and morphed it into political influence with weekly segments on "Fox and Friends," where he started peddling the birther conspiracy theory that former President Barack Obama was ineligible to be president.

But it was his use of Twitter to hijack news cycles with outrageous statements that really boosted his presidential campaign. What Trump understood better than most is that news doesn't have a liberal or a conservative bias as much as a conflict bias -- and he supplied constant conflict in ways that fired up his base while dominating news cycles on stations and sites across the political spectrum.

JUST WATCHED Stephen Miller: From white supremacist sites to the White House Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Stephen Miller: From white supremacist sites to the White House 03:05

The Republican establishment couldn't stop his rise, because the conservative base had become radicalized by hyper-partisan media while many on the center-right had opted out of the party.

It was a joint effort. During the 2016 campaign, Trump relied on regular strategic conversations with Ailes and Sean Hannity, while bringing on the former head of Breitbart News, Steve Bannon, to run his campaign. Put simply, Trump promoted hyper-partisan media, and they promoted him in return.

On the most extreme edge, we even learned that the campaign's senior policy adviser, Stephen Miller, was back-channeling with Breitbart to influence their immigration coverage with white nationalist sites. On a far more prominent and less fringe scale, The Washington Post's Erik Wemple chronicled Hannity's many mentions in campaign emails and called him their "chief propagandist ... looped in on all their talking points, their deflections and their innumerable attacks."

During the final weeks of the campaign, when few even inside Trump's orbit believed he could win, Trump was musing about starting his own right-wing television station -- Trump TV -- to be led by none other than Ailes. It would allow him to monetize the movement he'd begun while continuing its momentum based on the idea that the election had been stolen.

But trolls and bots on social media -- many of them connected to Russia -- were engaging in an all-out final push to try to elect Trump, exploiting the environment of extremism and distrust that partisan media created, posting intentionally fake stories at an accelerated rate. In the final three months of the campaign, the top performing intentionally false stories on Facebook -- designed to benefit Trump and hurt Hillary Clinton -- out-performed the top news stories from actual publications, according to the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee report.

The top two fake news stories were Pope Francis' (non-existent) endorsement of Trump and Wikileaks' "confirmation" of Hillary Clinton's weapons sales to ISIS -- which reached more than 1.7 million people. One analyst explained that "it seems pretty clear that false information outperforms true information."

President-elect Trump quickly tried to twist the term "fake news" -- which helped him win the election -- to refer to any independent journalism that displeased him in any way. He has used the term more than 1,100 times since inauguration, according to Factba.se, while autocrats around the world approvingly picked up the term.

Partisan media was in the White House, and Trump's relationship with Fox News became something unseen in American history -- with the President constantly watching and tweeting out promos to friendly shows while hiring more than 20 administration aides from the extended Fox talent pool.

When his staffers burnt out or were forced out, they often found jobs at Fox -- while a few lonely correspondents and anchors such as Shepard Smith committed to facts found themselves under fire from viewers as well as the President.

"I've never seen anything like it before," Fox News president-turned-NYU journalism professor Joe Peyronnin told The New Yorker's Jane Mayer . "It's as if the President had his own press organization. It's not healthy."

Partisan media takes over the White House

We see that partisan media has completed its takeover of the White House -- electing and bolstering an unpopular President while perpetuating a separate political reality for his supporters. But there is a cost to living in that closed environment.

The fourth impeachment inquiry in American history was launched because Trump bought into discredited conspiracy theories that Ukraine -- not Russia -- had hacked the Democratic National Committee while pushing that country's new President to investigate the family of his chief political rival. These ideas were allegedly spread from interested parties and fringe sites to being investigated by Trump's personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani -- who fed information to The Hill's John Solomon -- whose articles created "evidence" used to justify the investigation. Solomon would in turn promote his stories on Hannity's show on Fox News -- creating a confirmation bias feedback loop built on falsehoods, or what the President's supporters might call "alternative facts."

The media coverage of the subsequent impeachment inquiry hearings was also polarized, with one side focused on testimony and facts, while the other side attacked the State Department and White House witnesses as "Never Trumpers," " nerdy guys ," "radicals," "partisan bureaucrats" and even a " self-important, very narcissistic diplomatic snowflake ." There's an inability to agree on basic facts, and instead the politics of personal attacks seem to have aligned with the President's talking points.

Confronting an age of unreason

There's no question that partisan media has driven the polarization that's afflicting our nation. It is driving the agenda in the White House. And proximity to power creates a gravitational pull toward normalization.

But the partisan echo chamber is a route to radicalization. As Cass Sunstein explains in his book "Going to Extremes," "A good way to create an extremist group, or a cult of any kind, is to separate members from the rest of society. The separation can occur physically or psychologically, by creating a sense of suspicion about non-members. With such separation, the information and views of those outside the group can be discredited, and hence nothing will disturb the process of polarization as group members continue to talk."

Partisan media has gone from advancing an ideological agenda to something uglier, something like a cult that is peddling special knowledge -- undermining our ability to reason together as Americans, while sharpening tribal divides. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
(CNN) 2017 was a year when discussions of press freedom and the media's choices reached a new level of intensity.

White House briefings, presidential tweets and rallies critiqued the media.

Journalists pushed back, while engaging in lively debate about the ways they approach their work.

And, perhaps fittingly, the year is about to end with the release of "The Post," a Steven Spielberg film, starring Meryl Streep and Tom Hanks, that retells the story of how an administration tried, and ultimately failed, to stop newspapers from printing a damning government report about the Vietnam War.

Despite the news coverage, the Hollywood treatment and the millions of words of commentary about these issues, just how much do most of us truly understand about why journalists do what they do and why the Constitution affords protection for free expression? <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) Throughout history, the media has been used to manipulate and influence political outcomes. Julius Caesar used war journaling, or a written firsthand account of war and its rationale, to justify the invasion and destruction of the Gallic tribes two millennia ago. His heir, Octavian, used a disinformation campaign to convince the Senate to declare war against Mark Antony.

In later years, new communications tools, such as the printing press and moveable type, made it easier for philosophers including John Locke and Thomas Paine to influence new forms of democracy, which, while imperfect, have been more successful than other forms of government.

What these historic figures didn't have access to is digital technology, which democratizes media but also eases the spread of disinformation. The internet allows all who have access to participate, but it also amplifies the effectiveness of media manipulation via automation. Botnets (which are made up of networks of individual, social media and bot accounts that appear to be owned by real people) act as a force multiplier, distributing disinformation in the form of "fake news" on a massive scale. We saw this in the 2016 US presidential election, as Russian propaganda flooded social media platforms to divide the nation.

However, a broad community of good actors, including foundations and nonprofits committed to journalistic integrity, are emerging to promote media literacy and good-faith reporting. As a news consumer and a philanthropist (not an expert), I'm invested in supporting these knowledgeable institutions and initiatives to ensure that we have access to fair and accurate reporting. I care about this issue because I believe a strong, vigorous and trustworthy press is the immune system of democracy.

Last year that immune system failed, which is why we need to focus on rebuilding and sustaining a trustworthy press now more than ever. While a complex task, given the evolving uses of technology in spreading disinformation, in order to remedy this issue we must create a more formalized journalistic code of ethics for the digital age.

This is the next installment in the CNN Opinion series on the challenges facing the media, under attack from critics, governments and changing technology.

(CNN) The hilariously inept attack on the Washington Post by an organization run by right-wing prankster James O'Keefe -- his latest in a catalog of failures, falsehoods and fraud -- is a "worst practices" list of things a true news organization should never, ever do.

O'Keefe has spent years attempting to expose alleged liberal bias in mainstream media organizations, which, in and of itself, is a worthy goal. Every member of a quality news organization -- editors, reporters, producers and executives -- should be prepared to explain and defend their work and methods: what stories we cover, how we do it and what assumptions or hidden biases might lie behind our choices.

But serious media critics have a responsibility, too, one that is equal to, if not greater than, the organizations they wish to expose. That means operating with honesty, fairness and good faith, taking care to back up accusations with concrete evidence.

But O'Keefe, whose website describes him as "an award-winning journalist," is more partisan prankster than honest critic. Despite naming his organization Project Veritas (Latin for "truth"), O'Keefe has frequently resorted to deceptive and occasionally illegal tactics, including the use of false identities , trespassing and selectively edited videos that have frequently been debunked <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) For years, newsrooms across America have had a problem with a lack of diversity and inclusion. People of color are underrepresented among news organizations, which do not reflect the makeup of the general population and have made little progress in the past decade.

Although non-whites make up about 40% of the US population, journalists of color comprise only 16.55% of newsrooms' staff in 2017, according to the American Society of Newspaper Editors (ASNE) Newsroom Employment Diversity Survey.

Larger newsrooms and digital news organizations are a little better — 23.4% and 24.3%, respectively — but not much. People of color are only 13.4% of newsroom leaders.

This comes at a time when society needs and demands more inclusive news . It's been 190 years since the creation of the black press, and it's as relevant as ever.

In the absence of an inclusive environment, the quality of journalism suffers. Certain stories are simply not reported, or are told without the nuance or perspective the circumstances require. The black press has filled that void for generations. And with the advent of digital platforms, a baton has been passed to black millennial writers to continue presenting narratives, with underrepresented points of views, that would otherwise go missing -- and do not necessarily reflect the white men who dominate the industry.

Far beyond using social media for entertainment, shopping or communication, African-American millennials have elevated Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and other platforms to raise public consciousness about the issues impacting black people. The hashtags #BlackLivesMatter and #OscarsSoWhite are prime examples of this phenomenon.

According to Nielsen, 55% of black consumers between 18 and 34 spend at least an hour on social media each day, 6% higher than all millennials. In addition, 29% of black millennials spend three or more hours daily on social media sites, 9% higher than that of all millennials.

While black millennials fall below their counterparts in the percentage of leisure time spent on social media, they exceed the general millennial population in their overall presence on Twitter, Tumblr, Google+ and Whatsapp. That online presence has translated into the creation of a network of black news outlets specifically creating content that will meet readers and viewers where they are.

Additionally, when the mainstream media covers a particular issue, the black press may cover it with a completely different angle -- if not a different issue altogether. For example, the black press rejected the mainstream media narrative that white "working class" support for Trump was primarily economic in nature, reporting instead on the presidential candidate's appeal to white solidarity, raw racism and the scapegoating of minority groups.

After all, white economic angst by itself does not reconcile the fact that whites always have fared better than their African- and Latino-Americans. And while the mainstream news organizations have framed the NFL protests through the prism of patriotism and support for the military, the black press has focused on the crisis of police brutality and racial violence that underlie the athletes' decision to take a knee during the national anthem.

Fifty years ago, when unrest rocked cities across the nation as a result of police brutality and systemic racism, the Kerner Commission -- an 11-member commission appointed by President Lyndon B. Johnson that highlighted racism for its role in a surge in urban riots -- took the news media to task.

"We have found a significant imbalance between what actually happened in our cities and what the newspaper, radio and television coverage of the riots told us happened," the Kerner report said

"Our second and fundamental criticism is that the news media have failed to analyze and report adequately on racial problems in the United States and, as a related matter, to meet the Negro's legitimate expectations in journalism. By and large, news organizations have failed to communicate to both their black and white audiences a sense of the problems America faces and the sources of potential solutions."

The Commission made a number of recommendations, including that news organizations employ black people beyond mere tokenism and in positions of real responsibility, and that they publish newspapers and produce programs that acknowledge black people, who they are and what they do.

Although newsrooms have made some progress, it's not where it should or needs to be. But by empowering themselves and their followers — without gatekeepers and intermediaries in the traditional media sense — young, black journalists have reached a broad audience. They can educate and mobilize others to act on a given issue, and connect with local, national and global social justice movements.

A videographer or documentarian can broadcast a crime in progress — such as a police beating of an unarmed motorist -- live and in real time, before an audience of thousands if not millions. In that regard, technology is the great equalizer, a check on the abuse of official power and a call to reform harmful patterns and discriminatory practices.

From its inception, the black press has been a change agent by shining a light on the plight of blacks and giving them the power to write and report on their own narratives. In New York in 1827, Rev. Samuel Cornish and John B. Russwurm began publication of Freedom's Journal, the first black-owned newspaper in America. Excluded from white venues and often insulted in their absence, black voices found the need to tell their own stories.

"We wish to plead our own cause. Too long have others spoken for us. Too long has the public been deceived by representations, in things which concern us dearly," wrote the editors in their first edition

Throughout the Civil War , black newspapers were centers for political debate on the war and emancipation, and advocacy for black soldiers. During Jim Crow and the reign of Klan terror, the black press fought against segregation, demanded equal rights for African Americans and helped elect politicians to office.

The Chicago Defender , which had demanded federal intervention from President Woodrow Wilson to stop lynchings, played a role in the Great Migration by urging a mass exodus of black people from the South.

In the 1890s, journalist Ida B. Wells led a campaign against lynching at considerable personal risk. Born a slave, she wrote about the injustices of racial segregation in the South. A mob descended upon her Memphis news office, destroyed her equipment and threatened her with death.

Over the years, many black publications disappeared. Others learned to navigate the new landscape, and a plethora of new black media emerged with a strictly online presence, impacting the manner that black people digest and make sense of the news.

The days of "reading the paper" are long gone for many, but what remains the same is that the black press doesn't look like the theoretical textbook case of objective journalism -- and it was never meant to be -- whatever that means to you.

When narratives are told from the perspective of a black lens, perhaps there are no two sides to a story. Perhaps there is only one side, or numerous sides with various textures and shades. What is certain is there is a sense of responsibility to the community, advocating for that community and telling their stories from their perspective.

A digital environment arms African-American millennial writers with tools that enable them to carve out their own territory in their unique and innovative way -- exercising free speech and contributing to a healthy democracy, and staying true to the proud history of the black press. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Suzanne Nossel is executive director of PEN America. She was formerly executive director of Amnesty International USA and deputy assistant secretary of state for international organizations at the State Department. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

(CNN) RT -- the Kremlin-funded news channel formerly known as "Russia Today," frequently cited as a central gear in Russia's propaganda machine -- is nothing if not colorful. The network is known for declaring the Boston Marathon bombings a government plot , publicly shaming its own journalists if they dare defy the Kremlin line and for featuring American commentators known for conspiracy-mongering.

Following years of hue and cry over the network's overt pro-Kremlin bias, earlier this month the Department of Justice forced the channel to file under the "Foreign Agents Registration Act," or FARA , a 1938 law that was initially passed to counter pro-Nazi propaganda and subsequently retooled in the 1960s to publicly pinpoint those lobbying on behalf of foreign interests.

Forcing RT to register as a foreign agent is justified, but isn't the best way to counter the propaganda the channel -- or any other source of disinformation for that matter -- puts out. While RT has howled its objections, the network may protest too much. Absent a far wider effort to incentivize and enable news consumers to distinguish serious news and analysis from agitprop, FARA registration or not, the influence of RT and other shady news sources may survive intact.

The problem is that while RT's FARA registration may make members of Congress and administration officials feel as though they've landed a blow in the fight against Russian propaganda, RT's filing with the Justice Department may well never register with most news consumers. From the looks of things there is no easy way for a consumer of RT to learn that it has filed as a foreign agent. It is not mentioned in the "About Us" section of RT nor flagged on RT stories that appear in Google searches. The same is true of the China Daily News, a media outlet long registered under FARA as an agent of the Chinese government.

News cognoscenti are already well aware of RT's lineage, but to get through to those who read and believe the network will require more than the fine print in a government filing.

Former FBI Director James Comey put it bluntly in testimony last March before the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, saying, "The Kremlin is waging an international disinformation campaign through the RT propaganda network which traffics in anti-American conspiracy theories that rivaled the extravagant untruths of Soviet era Pravda."

In late October Twitter announced that it would "off-board" all advertising from RT and Sputnik, another Russian-controlled platform, based on its own investigation and on US intelligence agencies' conclusion that the networks had sought to influence the outcome of the 2016 election at Putin's behest.

Whereas FARA contains an exception for bona fide media organizations, those state-owned entities that have qualified for it -- including the BBC and Germany's Deutsche Welle -- have strong layers of publicly visible and reputable independent governance that shield editorial decision-making from government interference.

While critics have been hard-pressed to argue that RT does not meet the criteria for registration under the act, they have rightly pointed out that by enforcing its provisions against the network, the US will likely trigger a wave of retaliatory and copycat measures designed by governments to clamp down on media outlets considered unfriendly. Indeed, the Russian Duma, acting at Putin's behest, moved swiftly to pass its own version of foreign media registration requirements last week. Russia's Ministry of Justice has let US government-backed networks, including Voice of American and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty (RFE/RL) know that they may be required to register under the new act. Russia is also reportedly considering more sweeping bans on the availability of foreign print media.

In some ways, these new measures are old news: US government-backed VOA and RFE/RL have been blocked from broadcasting in Russia for years. The more worrying prospect is that repressive regimes elsewhere in the world -- think the Philippines' Rodrigo Duterte or Uzbekistan's Islam Karimov -- are emboldened in acting to foster local distrust of credible international media outlets.

With consumers accessing the vast majority of their news via Facebook and other social media feeds, the likelihood that news of RT's filing will color the reception of its stories among those who currently tune in seems dim. Tangible indicators of likely veracity -- including information about the news source, its track record, ethical guidelines and reporting methods -- can be ferreted out only through time-consuming research, if at all. A study earlier this year by the Media Insight Project revealed that consumers are far more likely to evaluate the veracity of a news article based on who shared it than what the source is.

If anything, worries about RT's influence point to the fact that transparency in American news media consumption cannot come solely, or even primarily, through force of law. Rather, we need Americans to be trained and educated to expect and demand transparency about ownership, editorial control, potential conflicts of interest and internal checks and processes to preserve objectivity and accuracy from the news that we consume. And, if outlets insist on remaining opaque on these fronts, as has RT, we should know to reject those outlets as unreliable.

We should prize voluntary transparency by news outlets, and should refuse to pay for, devote our attention to, do business with and share information from outlets unwilling to be transparent. As primary conduits for news, social media platforms have an essential role to play in equipping and empowering users to get the information they need to make sound judgments about what they're reading and sharing.

In an open media ecosystem, especially as one as large and freewheeling as the internet, government regulation is never going to be a satisfactory answer for the scourge of fraudulent news or propaganda.

Ultimately, the best defense against fake news and foreign propaganda lies in comprehensive public education on the uses and misuses of media. News literacy curricula in schools and workplaces, easier-to-use reference material tied to news shared online, transparent newsroom policies on subjects like conflicts of interest and corrections and rigorous methods of sourcing and crediting are all essential to enabling news consumers to navigate the information ocean in which many now drown.

It is true that Americans are fiercely independent in choosing what media to consume and credit. But no one wants to be fooled. Rather than consoling ourselves that RT's motives and loyalties will now be laid bare, the network's belated registration under FARA is just one more reminder that absent more far-reaching action, purveyors of propaganda and fraudulent news will likely continue to work their will on a populace that is ill-equipped to defend itself. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) When a California judge entered an unlawful order sealing an entire lawsuit file -- including, bizarrely, even the court order imposing the seal -- outraged journalists took action to defend the public's right to know.

With the help of volunteer legal counsel, reporters Anumita Jain and Armaan Rashid filed a petition in a Contra Costa County court to unseal the case file, which involves a school district's decision to discipline a Danville student over a homemade social-media video said to depict Arabs as terrorists. The school district's decision to remove the student as president of the student government association as punishment for the video -- and then restore him to the position after a public outcry -- dominated two local school board meetings, but without access to the court file, the details of the case (including the contents of the video) remain a puzzle to the community.

There's nothing especially novel about the case -- except that the journalists are themselves in high school , staff members of the Wildcat Tribune newspaper that has provided the community's most thorough and reliable coverage of the lawsuit and the controversy behind it.

"As journalists, Rashid and Jani are attempting to discharge their duties in the highest and best ethical tradition by obtaining direct access to first-hand documentation about a news event," says their motion to unseal the file, which is awaiting a ruling in Contra Costa County Superior Court.

That high school journalists are capable of work rivaling that of professionals, and that they have taken the lead in battling a lack of government transparency, should come as no surprise to anyone. Some of the best journalism in America today is coming out of student-run outlets, as demonstrated by the acclaimed investigative reporting of a team at Kansas' Pittsburg High School, who so painstakingly discredited their newly hired principal's inflated resumé that she was forced to resign.

It may come as more of a surprise to learn that in many ways, this dedication is more the rule than the exception. Student journalists are, increasingly, the information lifeline for their communities. With employment in traditional newsrooms hitting historic lows , down 42% since 1990, the public is more reliant than ever on students to sound the alarm if schools are unsafe or ineffective -- or if there's any story unfolding on their campus that could affect their community. Education news now accounts for just 1.4% of the time and space in mainstream media outlets, according to a 2009 study by the Brookings Institution. It's up to students to fill that information void -- if their schools will let them.

High schools often nurture the mentality that students have a "civic duty" to say only favorable things about the education they're receiving. "Be true to your school" is a nice enough idea -- but you won't find it in the Constitution. "Citizens will be punished if they question or criticize the government" isn't a sentiment that belongs in any American educational institution. As a lawyer assisting students in censorship cases, I once had a school superintendent in Tennessee tell me that a student's political column was rejected because it "might cause passionate conversations" -- as if passionate conversations about politics were a distraction from learning and not central to it.

Regrettably, for every student in a well-supported journalism program at a secondary school empowered to use media to right wrongs, there is another student who's been bullied and silenced by image-obsessed school authorities whose highest priority is avoiding controversy, not providing a quality education.

In Flushing, New York, for example , a principal refused to print an entire edition of the Advocate newspaper in spring 2017 because of a column that captured students' honest assessment of the shortcomings of Flushing High School (in particular, one student's comment that "out of my 8 classes, only 3 of my teachers really care.")

In Omaha, Nebraska, school authorities retaliated against the Pawprint student news outlet at Millard West High School for a factually accurate article questioning the propriety of some (unnamed) teachers' classroom criticisms of President Trump. First, they pulled the article offline. Then, after relenting in the face of a potential First Amendment lawsuit, they removed a well-credentialed faculty adviser from her job -- just weeks after her students won the best-in-state award for the newspaper she advised.

In the Chicago suburb of Steinmetz in 2016, a high school principal ordered the student newspaper shuttered and the journalism program canceled in mid-semester after a student reporter defied his orders not to write on her personal off-campus blog about a controversy over changing the starting time of the school day. (The school district ultimately overruled the decision after private benefactors stepped forward to volunteer to pay for printing the newspaper.)

While it seems outrageous for schools to use their power over students for purposes of public relations or image maintenance, it's not clear that it's illegal.

In a 1988 ruling, Hazelwood School District v. Kuhlmeier , the US Supreme Court stripped students of all meaningful constitutional protection when they use a school-provided publication or platform to convey their speech. The Hazelwood decision was widely denounced by First Amendment scholars at the time, and it hasn't aged well -- imagine, in 2017, trying to prevent high school students from learning about teen pregnancy by yanking pages out of newspapers, as the principal of Hazelwood East High School did -- but it endures as a stain on the lawbooks. In the 30 years since, there is only one documented case of a high school journalist successfully challenging school censorship in court, a 2004 case in which a Michigan student was prevented from publishing a truthful article about a lawsuit against her school because the school didn't want to call public attention to the case.

Fortunately, help is on the way. Increasingly, state legislators are recognizing the unique educational value of student journalism and stepping up to protect the journalists that Hazelwood left vulnerable.

California and Kansas were among the first states to embrace press freedom in schools, and it's no coincidence that the courageous public-service journalism being done in Danville and Pittsburg isn't being seen in Flushing or in Omaha.

Thirteen states from coast-to-coast now protect student journalism against image-motivated censorship, and bills are anticipated in at least a half-dozen other states in 2018.

The case for protecting press freedom in schools isn't just about training future journalists. It's about developing inquisitive, participatory citizens willing to ask the hard questions of government authorities that involved citizenship demands.

It's also about rooting out systemic inequality. Research by University of Kansas scholars documents that censorship is a pervasive problem in high school newsrooms -- and that it disproportionately affects young women.

More than half of all female students surveyed during the 2015 school year reported that they'd "self-censored" from pursuing a story, anticipating an adverse reaction from school authorities -- a rate twice that of male students. And more than one-third of all students said they'd been categorically banned from talking about certain topics in student media. (The most frequently forbidden subject? Unthinkably, in the midst of an epidemic of opioid fatalities, it's substance abuse.)

Kansas journalism professor Peter Bobkowski, co-leader of the survey, has documented the civic-education benefits of working in a student newsroom where First Amendment principles are honored. After separately surveying 900 high school journalists across a variety of schools in Kansas and Missouri, Bobkowski found that students whose journalistic work is respected and valued develop greater confidence (what he calls "civic efficacy") in their ability to use their voices to make social and political change.

It's fashionable to point fingers at social-justice-drunk "snowflakes" for devaluing the First Amendment in higher education, but that misses the point. Students arriving on America's college campuses have largely spent the formative years of their educational lives watching fundamental constitutional principles devalued and their rights and voices routinely disregarded without consequence by respected authority figures.

It's no mystery why students believe it's the government's job to protect them from offensive speech: the Supreme Court told them in Hazelwood that the government's interest in avoiding political controversy is more important than freedom of the press, and they've lived that reality every day of their K-12 lives. The erosion of First Amendment values will be reversed only when schools reopen their doors to the "passionate conversations" that effective civic learning requires. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Daniel Pearl

Daniel Pearl was the South Asia Bureau Chief for the Wall Street Journal, based in Mumbai, India. Pearl was reportedly on his way to an interview in Karachi, Pakistan for a story about the “shoe bomber,” Richard Reid, when he was kidnapped on January 23, 2002. Investigators say he was led into a trap, believing he was to meet with Sheikh Mubarak Ali Shah Gilani. His captors demanded better conditions for prisoners being held at Guantanamo Bay and threatened to kill Pearl if the demands weren’t met. Pearl was killed sometime between the end of January and early February, though the US government only confirmed Pearl’s beheading on February 21, 2002. Four men were convicted in the case. Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh, a British-born Islamic militant, was sentenced to death, while the other three were given life terms. In 2016, the Pakistani military thwarted a plot to free Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, as suspected mastermind of the 9/11 attacks being held by the United States, has said he personally killed Pearl. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) During the House Intelligence Committee's investigation of President Donald Trump's effort to pressure Ukraine into announcing an investigation of the Bidens, the committee issued 71 subpoenas and requests for information. The Trump administration, in response, produced nothing -- not a single piece of paper.

So, it's only fair to ask: What are they hiding?

We just got our first small hint, and the answer is alarming. A federal judge ordered the administration to turn over documents subject to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by the Center for Public Integrity. And just one of those documents -- an e-mail from Michael Duffey , a Trump appointee who served in the Office of Management and Budget, to other OMB and Pentagon officials -- gives us a tantalizing look at the administration's efforts to withhold foreign aid to Ukraine, and to cover up its own conduct.

Duffey -- one of four witnesses requested by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in Trump's upcoming Senate impeachment trial -- sent the e-mail roughly 90 minutes after Trump's July 25 phone call with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. The Duffey e-mail is a prosecutor's dream, opening up various lines of potentially fruitful questioning.

First question: Who gave you the referenced guidance? Second question: What was the guidance? Clearly, somebody in the White House who was senior to Duffey told him to make sure to hold back foreign aid to Ukraine -- and did it right after Trump's call with Zelensky. The answer to these questions could provide information vital to understand Trump's actions and motives toward Ukraine.

Duffey later instructs in the e-mail, "Given the sensitive nature of the request, I appreciate your keeping that information closely held."

Ok, Duffey: explain the "sensitive nature" of the request to hold back funding from Ukraine? Why was it sensitive? Who told you it was sensitive? The answers to these questions could prove damning to Trump and his most senior officials.

Remember: the Duffey e-mail is just one piece of paper out of likely thousands, or more, that the administration has but refuses to turn over. If this one e-mail raises so many important questions, just imagine what we don't yet know.

I believe we will see many or perhaps all of the documents that the administration is withholding -- somehow, someday. The documents might come out, like the Duffey e-mail did, through Freedom of Information Act requests. Or they might become public through other lawsuits, subpoenas by Congress or prosecutors, disclosure by future administrations, or leaks. But, one way or another, we will eventually learn what this administration may be hiding.

The problem, of course, is that we may not know what the Trump administration is covering up until it is too late -- until this administration is long gone, or until it is too late to fix the damage.

Now, your questions

Scott (Tennessee): If the Senate acquits Trump, but then he does something else later in his term that merits impeachment, can the House impeach him again? Or, is there a double jeopardy rule against impeaching a person twice?

No, the double jeopardy rule does not apply to impeachment. Double jeopardy is a concept unique to criminal law. The Fifth Amendment of the Constitution provides that "nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb."

The "in jeopardy of life or limb" language refers to criminal penalties -- including imprisonment or execution -- and not to impeachment, where the only penalty is removal from office.

While the double jeopardy rule means that a person cannot be charged twice for the same criminal offense, the Constitution provides no such legal protection against a second impeachment. No federal official , however, has ever been impeached twice in the United States.

Although second impeachment is legally possible, practical obstacles certainly would arise. It seems exceedingly unlikely as a political matter that the House would impeach a President, see that President acquitted in the Senate and then impeach him again for the same conduct.

If, however, a President was impeached, acquitted, and then committed new impeachable acts, the House could be more willing to impeach again.

Turtley (New York): House Republicans claim that all the evidence against Trump is indirect. Are criminal cases ever decided solely on indirect evidence?

Yes, a jury can convict in a criminal case based solely on indirect (also called "circumstantial") evidence, if it finds that indirect evidence sufficient to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

Here's how judges explain the concept of direct versus indirect evidence to juries. Let's say you looked out the window of the courtroom and saw raindrops falling down and hitting the window. That would be direct evidence that it is raining outside. Now let's say the window shades were drawn, but you saw three people walk into the courtroom, all wearing raincoats, holding umbrellas and dripping wet. That would be indirect -- but still relevant and potentially decisive -- evidence that it is raining outside.

House Republicans' claim that the case against Trump consists of "no direct evidence" is not true, in any event. The July 25 call between Trump and Zelensky, for example, is direct evidence: you can look at it and see Trump's own words to Zelensky, much as you could look out the courtroom window and see raindrops.

There also is plenty of indirect evidence. For example, Ambassador Bill Taylor testified that it was unusual and unexplained that military aid to Ukraine was held back. A reasonable juror could -- but need not necessarily -- infer from this indirect evidence, all with the other indirect evidence, that the aid was held back in order to pressure Ukraine.

Marty (Texas): Now that Trump has been impeached, does he lose the ability to issue pardons?

No, but the confusion here is understandable. Article II of the Constitution provides that the President "shall have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment."

On this point, the Constitution -- venerable document that it is -- loses points for ambiguity. Read one way, it could appear to say that after the President is impeached by the House, he loses the power to issue pardons. But read another way, it says that the President can issue pardons for criminal offenses but not for impeachment.

The latter reading is correct . There is no provision anywhere in the Constitution, statutes or case law that strips a president of any power upon impeachment by the House (though of course, if convicted in the Senate, the President loses office and all of its powers). It would be anomalous for the President to lose only one power -- the power to pardon -- upon impeachment alone, and no serious legal authority has argued for this interpretation.

Rather, the clause in Article II means that while a President can pardon an official (or any person) for a crime, he cannot pardon an official out of impeachment. In other words, the President does not have power to un-impeach. For example, if a federal judge committed bribery, the President could pardon the judge from a criminal bribery charge, but the President could not rescue the judge from impeachment. Indeed, no president has ever pardoned or even attempted to pardon an official from impeachment.

This makes sense in our broader system of checks and balances. The Constitution grants Congress the "sole power" to impeach, as one of its most powerful checks on the President and the executive branch. If the President could simply issue pardons to undo an impeachment, he could unilaterally deprive Congress of one of its vital tools, effectively rendering it moot.

Three questions to watch

1) How long will House Speaker Nancy Pelosi wait before formally sending Articles of Impeachment to the Senate?

2) Will Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer make any progress toward a negotiated deal for Trump's Senate impeachment trial?

3) Will Trump and McConnell pursue an aggressive trial strategy, or will they go with a minimalist approach to get it over with quickly? <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) Give Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell this much: at least he's open and transparent about his plan to rig the upcoming Senate impeachment trial of President Donald Trump. McConnell -- who will serve as both judge (in his capacity as majority leader to set the procedure before trial) and juror (as one of the 100 senators who will vote to convict or acquit Trump) -- came right out and said that he will work "in total coordination with the White House counsel." McConnell's disdain for even the appearance of a fair process is so pointed that it seems his end goal is to de-legitimize the upcoming trial before it begins.

McConnell is not the only future impeachment juror to have made rash statements about the upcoming trial. Senator Lindsey Graham, abandoning all pretext of impartiality, proudly declared that he's "not trying to pretend to be a fair juror here." And this tendency to pre-judge crosses party lines.

For example, Elizabeth Warren has stated that what Trump "has done is an impeachable offense, and he should be impeached."

It is bad for the process when senators of either party publicly undermine their obligation to be impartial. But McConnell's conduct is worse than that. Each senator is one vote out of 100, but McConnell's pronouncement that he will totally coordinate with the White House is destructive to the underlying constitutional process we are about to see unfold.

An impeachment trial is different in many respects from a criminal trial, but the criminal process provides a useful point of reference. If a person in McConnell's position -- judge or juror -- tried to coordinate with a party to a criminal case, he would be thrown off the case, disciplined and potentially prosecuted for obstruction of justice. While this isn't a criminal case, McConnell's comments show his disregard for the weight of the moment.

It is hard to miss that McConnell's pronouncement comes with a note of glee. Far from being secretive or apologetic about his coordination with the White House, he has come right out and boasted about it. It seems his cynical bottom line goal is to de-legitimize the process -- to promote the broad public view that the Senate trial is not a meaningful truth-finding exercise but rather empty political theater. His remarks seem designed to elicit a dismayed shake of the head and then a "what are you gonna do?" shrug from the populace. McConnell likely will get what he wants -- a quick acquittal of Trump -- but only at the long-term cost of public confidence in the integrity of our political and legal processes.

Now, your questions

Vignesh (New Jersey): What is the significance of the Supreme Court agreeing to hear the cases relating to Trump's tax returns?

The Supreme Court last week granted certiorari (meaning, in plain English, it "agreed to review") Trump's efforts to block disclosure of his tax returns. The court consolidated three separate cases for its consideration -- two involving congressional subpoenas and a third involving a subpoena from the Manhattan district attorney's office, all served on private companies handling Trump's personal finances.

This is a temporary win for Trump. In all three cases, both the trial-level federal district courts and the intermediate level courts of appeals have ruled against Trump and upheld the subpoenas. Had the Supreme Court declined to review the cases, those courts of appeals rulings would have become final, and Trump's tax returns would have been disclosed to Congress and the district attorney.

But, longer term, the ruling might prove to be more of a reprieve for Trump than a win. It would take quite a reversal for the Supreme Court to find that all the lower courts got it wrong -- though, as the nation's highest arbiter, the court certainly can and does overturn lower courts as it sees fit.

Some speculate that it is a good sign for Trump that the Supreme Court agreed to take the case. The court requires four votes (out of nine justices) to grant review. So, the thinking might go, we can assume at least four justices felt a need to take the cases and prevent the lower court rulings from taking effect, signaling an inclination to reverse.

On the other hand, it could be that four (or more) justices voted to take the cases because they recognized the enormous constitutional stakes presented by an inter-branch dispute between Congress and the White House (in the two Congressional cases) and between a state prosecutor and the federal executive branch (in the Manhattan district attorney office's case).

We will get a ruling from the court by June 2020 at the latest. The decision therefore could hit right in the heart of presidential campaign season. Depending on the outcome, the ruling could be either an embarrassing rebuke (and potentially worse) to Trump, or a vindication of his long-claimed right to withhold his personal financial information from Congress and prosecutors.

Tom (Colorado): Will the representatives and senators vote on each article of impeachment separately, or will there be one vote for both articles?

When the full House votes later this week on the two pending articles of impeachment against Trump, each member will vote separately on each article. Similarly, at the conclusion of a Senate trial, each Senator will vote yes or no on each article.

So it won't be an all-or-nothing proposition. Some members of Congress might split their votes -- likely with some members voting "yes" on Article I (Abuse of Power relating to Ukraine) but "no" on Article II (Obstruction of Congress), reasoning that Trump's defiance of congressional subpoenas is less serious or more defensible than his attempt to pressure Ukraine to investigate his political rivals.

While not likely, we could end up with a split outcome, with one article passing and the other failing in the House. That type of split decision happened in the Bill Clinton impeachment in 1998. The House Judiciary Committee approved four articles of impeachment, but the full House approved two while rejecting two others.

Gary (New York): Who serves as the defense lawyers and prosecutors in a Senate impeachment trial?

The President can hire any attorneys who are willing to put forward his defense. During the 1999 Clinton impeachment trial, a team comprised of White House counsel and private attorneys defended the President on the Senate floor. Similarly here, it appears Trump will go with White House Counsel Pat Cipollone as his lead attorney, plus reportedly outside attorneys including former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi.

(CNN) Now that House Democrats have announced they will introduce two articles of impeachment against President Donald Trump -- one for abuse of power and one for obstruction of Congress -- the focus will turn to the evidence supporting those charges at a seemingly inevitable Senate trial.

The witnesses who have testified before the House Intelligence Committee over the past month -- Ambassador Bill Taylor, Fiona Hill, Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman and the rest -- have provided important context to Trump's effort to withhold foreign aid and a White House visit from Ukraine in exchange for a public announcement of investigations of former Vice President Joe Biden, Hunter Biden and the 2016 election. But the star witness of the case against President Trump is and always has been Trump himself.

In Monday's House Judiciary Committee hearing, House Democrats sought to put the spotlight right back on Trump, whose own words and actions make the case for impeachment more directly and powerfully than any other witness could. Throughout his opening statement, House Intelligence Committee lead attorney Daniel Goldman prominently featured Trump's own words. Rep. Pramila Jayapal astutely noted that "the President himself is the smoking gun" and that Trump is "the first and best witness" against himself.

The President himself discussed foreign aid with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and then infamously stated , "I would like you to do us a favor though." Trump himself then asked Zelensky to conduct two (and only two) specific investigations -- one of the Bidens and the other of the 2016 election.

Just to drive home the point, Trump publicly stated from the White House grounds that "President Zelensky, if it were me, I would recommend that they start an investigation into the Bidens." For good measure, he added , "And, by the way, likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens." Donald Trump said those words, in public and on the record. There's no way around it.

Beyond his own damning requests for Ukraine to launch investigations into his political rivals, Trump also obstructed Congress, in broad daylight and in his own words. He issued a blanket order to stonewall Congress' investigative efforts: "We're fighting all the subpoenas." And he directly attacked various congressional witnesses including Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch -- as she testified before the House Intelligence Committee -- plus Jennifer Williams, Taylor and Vindman

Even if no other witnesses had come forward to testify, Trump's own words are enough to merit impeachment based on the Ukraine shakedown and obstruction of Congress. And the trick about Trump's own words is that Republicans can't run from them. They can try to twist and dodge, but ultimately to no persuasive effect. Trump supporters can don all the "Read the Transcript" T-shirts they can get printed up at the screening shop, but it still doesn't make the actual transcript any less incriminating.

And there is simply no contesting the fact that Trump's own words are the most firsthand of all firsthand information. Any prosecutor knows that there is no more damaging evidence than a defendant's own incriminating statements -- particularly if they have been recorded.

Trump and his defenders can deflect, or they can take the position that his conduct is not impeachable, or they can simply refuse to engage on the merits. But they can never escape the stark reality laid out by the President himself, in his own words.

Now, your questions:

Thomas (North Carolina): Can and should the House include obstruction of justice relating to Robert Mueller's investigation in articles of impeachment?

The House certainly could have included (and, if necessary, still can add) an article of impeachment based on Trump's efforts to obstruct Robert Mueller's investigation. The House holds the "sole power of impeachment" under the Constitution , and can impeach for essentially any matter it sees fit and can obtain a majority vote.

The trickier question is whether the House should have included a Mueller-based article of impeachment. On one hand, Mueller concluded that Trump committed at least 10 potentially obstructive acts, and it is difficult to imagine that any person -- especially the President -- could get away with such flagrant conduct without any tangible consequence. History needs to know what this President did while in office, even if an article of impeachment is unlikely to result in conviction in the Senate.

On the other hand, Democrats might fear diluting or distracting from their likely lead charge on the Ukraine scandal. If Democrats have a strong and clear case to make on Ukraine, then why risk revisiting the Mueller findings, which are tougher to understand and less politically viable at this point? As a prosecutor, I was trained to keep the message to the jury as clear and concise as possible; adding an article of impeachment for Mueller accomplishes neither.

Even though the House has not included Mueller's findings on obstruction of justice as a freestanding article of impeachment, it's clear they will come up because House Democrats mentioned in their draft of articles of impeachment that the President's actions were "consistent with previous invitations of interference in the United States election."

The very day after Mueller testified that Russia had interfered in our 2016 election to benefit Trump, and would try to do so again in 2020, Trump had his infamous July 25 phone call with Zelensky, during which Trump asked Zelensky to investigate the Bidens. As House Democrats describe Trump's conduct in their Intelligence Committee Report, "the solicitation of new foreign intervention was the act of a president unbound, not one chastened by experience."

Simon (California): Is it an impeachable offense for President Trump to order witnesses who have been subpoenaed by the House not to testify?

House Democrats have brought an article of impeachment against Trump for obstruction of Congress based on Trump's blanket refusal to comply with Congressional subpoenas. As House Intelligence Committee Democrats wrote in their report on the Ukraine investigation, "President Trump engaged in an unprecedented campaign of obstruction of this impeachment inquiry."

Republicans counter that the President has a right to challenge subpoenas in court, and that it is an overreach to impeach merely because the administration has resisted subpoenas based on legal disagreement.

Democrats argue that Trump's obstruction efforts go well beyond good-faith legal arguments; Trump himself announced a blanket stonewalling policy: "We're fighting all the subpoenas." In fact, Trump's obstructive conduct here goes beyond that of former President Richard Nixon, who defied some Congressional subpoenas but complied with others -- resulting in a draft article of impeachment against Nixon for obstruction of Congress. If partial obstruction by Nixon merited an article of impeachment, then full obstruction would seem to merit the same outcome for Trump.

James (Missouri): What is the significance of the Supreme Court's decision to put a hold on the release of Trump's financials? Is it likely to be resolved before the election next year?

The Supreme Court issued a temporary hold on a Court of Appeals decision requiring two banks to turn over Trump's financial information to the Democratic-controlled House Intelligence and Financial Services Committees. This is purely a procedural move, designed to give the Supreme Court time to consider whether it will review the decision -- and, in this instance, perhaps two other similar Court of Appeals decisions requiring financial service companies to turn over information about Trump to Congress and the Manhattan district attorney.

This is a common move and does not suggest hostility by the Supreme Court to the lower court opinions. It does tell us that the Supreme Court is seriously considering whether it should take up any or all of the cases.

If the court does take the cases, it will rule by the end of its term in October 2020 (before the November election). And if the court does not take any of the cases, then the lower Court of Appeals decisions become final, and the financial services companies must turn over the information pursuant to the contested subpoenas.

(CNN) President Donald Trump has instructed his attorneys to sit out Wednesday's House Judiciary Committee hearing on the "Constitutional Grounds for Presidential Impeachment," apparently choosing to play the victim of an unfair process rather than engaging on the actual facts and merits of the case for impeachment. Even without the presence of Trump's legal team, the hearing provides House Democrats with a valuable opportunity to drive home to Congress and the American public two fundamental points about impeachment that Trump has thus far succeeded in obscuring. This week's hearing -- if properly executed by House Democrats -- can correct vital misconceptions that Trump and his supporters have perpetrated on the American public as a means to keep him in office at any cost.

First, contrary to Trump's claims, impeachment is not a "coup." It is not a forceful takeover of government but rather a fundamental feature of our constitutional democracy. The Constitution specifically provides for impeachment in both Articles I (establishing the legislative branch) and II (establishing the presidency and executive branch) as the government's method to remove corrupt officials. While impeachment is among the most drastic remedies available to Congress, the American public should not fear impeachment or view it with dread. Impeachment is in the Constitution because the Founders meant for it to be there as a check on abuse or misuse of political power.

Second, Congress does not need to base impeachment on a statutory crime. While I believe Trump's conduct does violate several federal criminal statutes , Congress need not prove that Trump committed any particular offense, but rather that he abused the power of the presidency. The phrase "treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors" is among the most confusing and hotly debated in our Constitution, but the history and precedent behind the phrase make the Founders' intent clear. The phrase comes from British Parliamentary practice, under which impeachment for non-criminal misconduct was common. The US House of Representatives has impeached federal officials for non-criminal malfeasance including "intoxication," "favoritism" and "oppressive conduct." President Andrew Johnson was impeached and tried (and acquitted in the Senate) on an article of impeachment for abuse of power, without reference to any crime. The House drafted Articles of Impeachment against former President Richard Nixon for abuse of power before he resigned. And the House considered (but voted down) a proposed Article of Impeachment against former President Bill Clinton for abuse of power.

Indeed, while criminal conduct can provide an especially powerful basis for impeachment, common sense dictates that it's not necessary for impeachment. Take, for example, a president who wins election but then abrogates his Constitutional duties: he refuses to make appointments, conduct foreign policy, serve as commander in chief of the military, or sign legislation. That president commits no crime but plainly must be subject to removal for misuse of public office.

House Democrats need to be strategic in this week's hearing. House Judiciary Chair Jerry Nadler already has made an unforced tactical error by failing to identify the specific expert witnesses who will testify on Wednesday before the Sunday deadline he gave to Trump's lawyers to respond, leaving the door wide open for Trump's attorneys to claim they cannot commit to attend without any knowledge of who will testify.

If Nadler makes an even bigger tactical mistake and allows testimony from Constitutional scholars to get too esoteric or theoretical, the message will be lost on the public and the end result could be more confusion about impeachment. But, focused properly, this week's hearing has potential to drive home vital lessons about impeachment and its proper role in our system of Constitutional checks and balances.

Now, your questions

Donald (New York): Will witnesses such as Don McGahn who have refused to testify in the House finally be compelled to testify?

A federal district court judge ruled last week that the House's subpoena on McGahn is valid and enforceable, rejecting the White House's argument that executive branch officials are "absolutely immune" from compelled Congressional testimony. The judge pointedly noted that "Presidents are not kings" and that the White House's concept of "absolute immunity" is "a fiction."

The case is not over. McGahn already has appealed , and oral argument will be heard in the court of appeals on January 3. After that court rules, the losing party almost certainly will seek review in the Supreme Court, which may or may not agree to take the case. Either way, we likely will not have a final ruling until February 2020 at the absolute earliest. The question is whether House Democrats can afford to wait that long, given the pressing timetable for impeachment.

The McGahn ruling is particularly important because it seems to apply to other witnesses who have declined to testify: White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney, former National Security Adviser John Bolton and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. But if Republicans are intent to run out the clock, they still can challenge subpoenas to these witnesses by arguing they are somehow materially distinguishable from McGahn. Those arguments do not seem to hold much merit, but they could do the trick of bogging cases down in court and running out the clock.

Armando (California): Are Trump's lawyers allowed to attend House impeachment hearings this week, and if so, do you think Trump will choose to have them participate?

However, after months of complaining that impeachment is "an illegitimate sham partisan process," Trump has opted to sit out this week's hearing (reserving his right to send attorneys to later Judiciary Committee proceedings). The strategy appears to be that, if Trump did send his attorneys, he would be expected to mount some substantive defense, whereas it might rally Trump's supporters to wave the flag and cry procedural foul. The decision not to engage on the facts and substantive merits is consistent with Trump's tendency thus far to steer public attention away from the actual evidence and towards his claims of victimization.

John (Canada): Assuming the House does not impeach or the Senate does not convict, can either still censure the President?

Yes, either the House or Senate can censure -- formally reprimand -- the President. The Constitution does not specifically provide for censure but either house of Congress has the ability to censure the President or other officials by a majority vote. The Senate has formally reprimanded a president only once -- Andrew Jackson in 1834 , over a dispute about the Bank of the United States; Jackson's own Democratic party later expunged the reprimand in 1837 when it took control of the Senate. The House has reprimanded various officials but never a president.

It seems unlikely that either party would pursue censure if impeachment or removal fail in the House or Senate, respectively. Republicans would have little interest in censuring a President of their own party (though it could provide cover for those who have stated Trump's conduct was bad but not impeachable). Democrats could seek censure as a last resort, but likely would be reluctant to pursue a purely symbolic consolation prize.

Three questions to watch this week:

Will Articles of Impeachment take shape, and will they include obstruction of Congress (based on Trump's withholding of documents and blocking of witnesses) or obstruction of justice (based on Robert Mueller's Russia investigation)?

Will Trump decide to have his legal team participate in the remainder of House Judiciary impeachment hearings <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) Now that the dust has settled after two weeks of riveting impeachment hearings on Capitol Hill, the primary lines of argument have emerged.

In one corner, President Donald Trump and his supporters point to his September 9 conversation with EU Ambassador Gordon Sondland, during which ( according to Sondland ) Trump said, "I want nothing. I want no quid pro quo."

In the other corner, we have testimony from multiple ambassadors and National Security Council officials that suggests Trump indeed conditioned foreign aid and a White House visit on Ukraine's announcement of investigations into Trump's political rivals.

But the fact that both sides have a line of argument does not mean those arguments are persuasively equal or cancel one another out. The vast weight of the evidence -- supported by logic and common sense -- indicates Trump wanted a quid pro quo. And upon scrutiny, Trump's self-serving denial carries little persuasive or evidentiary weight, and provides a flimsy shield for Trump and his supporters to hide behind.

The "I want nothing" defense -- no matter how many times or how loudly Trump shouts it -- is a cheap distraction and should not divert attention from the actual evidence of his corrupt intent.

Both the law and common sense tell us that a self-serving denial made after a person has been caught carries limited if any value. Criminal defendants generally are not allowed to offer evidence at trial of their own self-serving, after-the fact denials of guilt (indeed, every criminal defendant who goes to trial already has proclaimed his lack of culpability by pleading not guilty).

Impeachment, of course, is not a criminal proceeding, and the rules of evidence do not apply. But it is telling that our established legal rules likely would deem Trump's self-serving denial too unreliable to use in court. The logic is so plain that even a child can understand it: once you've been caught with your hand in the cookie jar, it doesn't make you innocent to announce, "I want no cookies!"

Trump's "I want nothing" defense also is crushed by the sheer weight of the evidence to the contrary. Boiled down, that evidence establishes two facts that even the most ardent Trump supporter cannot credibly contest: (1) Trump held up foreign aid to Ukraine and a potential White House visit, and (2) Trump asked Ukraine to investigate his political rivals. The big question, then, is whether (1) and (2) are related: were the foreign aid and White House visit held up in order to get the investigations, or was it just a cosmically unlikely coincidence that both of these things happened, independent and unconnected to one another?

Common sense alone answers the question, but if that wasn't enough, witness after witness testified that the foreign aid and White House visit were indeed connected to the investigations. Acting Ambassador to Ukraine Bill Taylor testified that "by mid-July it was becoming clear to me that the meeting President Zelensky wanted was conditioned on the investigations of Burisma and alleged Ukrainian interference in the 2016 US elections."

Lt. Col. Alex Vindman, who listened to the July 25 call in his capacity on the National Security Council, described "a demand for him [Zelensky] to fulfill his—fulfill this particular prerequisite in order to get the meeting."

Even Ambassador Sondland, central to Trump's September 9 defense, acknowledged that he directly proposed a conditional exchange to a key Ukrainian adviser, and Ambassador Kurt Volker, the former Special Representative for Ukraine negotiations, explicitly offered a similar this-for-that exchange in a text message to the same adviser.

White House acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney admitted publicly there was a quid pro quo (though he later walked it back). And, upon any sensible reading, Trump himself directly proposed a conditional exchange in his July 25 call with Zelensky, according to the White House's own transcript of the call: "I would like you to do us a favor though..."

Do not be distracted by the "I want nothing!" defense. It has a certain simple, visceral appeal, and provides a convenient bumper-sticker slogan for Trump and his defenders. But it cannot stand up to the facts or common sense.

Now, your questions

Tony (Kansas): The evidence shows that Trump and Giuliani didn't care about an actual investigation of the Bidens and 2016, but only a public announcement of an investigation. How does that affect the case for impeachment?

Testimony from Lt. Col. Vindman, Ambassador Sondland, and National Security Council official Tim Morrison -- and other evidence including text messages between US and Ukraine officials -- establishes that the "deliverable" Trump and Giuliani sought from Ukraine was not necessarily an actual criminal investigation of the Bidens but rather a public announcement of the investigation.

This detail is compelling circumstantial evidence of the state of mind of Trump and Giuliani. Their primary focus on a public announcement indicates that their true motive was political -- ensuring the public knew Biden was under criminal investigation -- rather than corruption-busting.

Indeed, as Giuliani surely knows, as a longtime prosecutor, there is good reason why good prosecutors conduct investigations almost entirely in secret: a public announcement of an ongoing investigation would tip off the targets and potential witnesses, and would seriously undermine fact-finding. The last thing any prosecutor -- or any person genuinely interested in fighting corruption -- would do is to insist on a public announcement of a corruption investigation.

Jason (North Dakota): Now that the evidence in the Roger Stone trial has proved that Trump knew about the leaked emails Wikileaks dumped, could Trump be charged once he is out of office for lying on his written answers to Robert Mueller?

Stone was convicted by a jury on all seven charges brought against him, including one count of lying to Congress for "testif[ying] falsely that he had never discussed his conversations" about the Wikileaks e-mail dump "with anyone involved in the Trump campaign." The evidence at trial , including phone call logs and testimony, established that Stone in fact discussed the Wikileaks email dump directly with Trump and other campaign officials including Steve Bannon.

But in his written answers to Mueller , Trump claimed he "do[es] not recall discussing Wikileaks" with Stone, "nor do I recall being aware of Mr. Stone having discussed WikiLeaks with individuals associated with my campaign."

There are only two possibilities: either Trump actually did not recall these conversations, or he lied in his responses to Mueller. While it seems highly unlikely that Trump forgot about conversations with a longtime adviser about a potentially crucial development in the presidential campaign -- especially given Trump's claim to have "one of the great memories of all time" -- it would be difficult for a prosecutor to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that Trump did not in fact forget.

It shouldn't be that easy to evade criminal liability, but sometimes "I do not recall" can be an effective legal cover. Robert Mueller bears some blame here; by accepting written responses from Trump rather than fighting for an in-person interview or grand jury testimony, Mueller left the door wide open for this facile dodge by Trump and his attorneys.

Tony (Oklahoma): How does the burden of proof in an impeachment trial compare to that of both a criminal trial and a civil trial, and is hearsay testimony allowed in an impeachment trial?

In a criminal case, the prosecutor must prove a defendant's guilt "beyond a reasonable doubt," which is the highest standard of proof in our legal system. In a civil trial, the plaintiff must prove the case by a "preponderance of the evidence," meaning proof that the allegations are more likely true than not true.

Article I of the Constitution broadly gives the Senate the "sole power to try all impeachments." But the Constitution does not specify any particular standard of proof necessary for conviction.

In the 1999 Senate impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, Clinton's lawyers made a motion to apply the criminal "beyond a reasonable doubt" standard, but those motions failed. So no particular standard of proof applies at all -- or, more precisely, each Senator can apply whatever standard of proof he or she feels appropriate.

Three questions to watch

1. Will John Bolton come forward to testify, particularly about his one-on-one conversation with Trump about releasing foreign aid to Ukraine?

This piece has been updated to reflect the latest news.

(CNN) With Tuesday's announcement by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi that the House will open a formal impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump, Pelosi has finally put constitutional duty above perceived political expediency.

House Democrats flubbed it the first time by spinning in circles, as Pelosi transparently slow-played the Mueller impeachment inquiry (or non-inquiry ) to its seemingly inevitable whimper of an ending. But there's a valuable lesson to be learned from the Mueller case: Impeachment is a remedy both for criminality and for non-criminal abuse of power. And there looks to be plenty of both in the rapidly-unfolding Ukraine scandal

Let's start with potential crimes. Based solely on Trump's own admissions and the latest Washington Post reporting -- that Trump suspended $400 million in aid to Ukraine just days before he spoke with the President of Ukraine about an investigation of alleged wrongdoing by Joe Biden, one of Trump's primary political opponents -- he could have violated any or all of these federal criminal laws.

Trump and his defenders claim his motive was to root out corruption generally in Ukraine, and Trump stated Tuesday that funds ultimately were paid to Ukraine, though he added, "I'd withhold again and I'll continue to withhold until such time as Europe and other nations contribute to Ukraine because they're not doing it." But why would Trump be so interested in corruption in Ukraine, if not for the Biden connection? Has he displayed similar levels of concern for corruption in other foreign countries?

Trump tweeted that he will release a complete, unredacted transcript of his call with the Ukrainian President on Wednesday. The details of that transcript will be crucial, but Trump's preemptive defense falls flat. First, Trump tweeted that his conversation with the Ukrainian President was "very friendly." That's irrelevant. People can be downright chipper while still soliciting bribes and foreign election aid.

Trump also claims he exerted "no pressure" during the call. Perhaps, but his decision to withhold hundreds of millions in foreign aid from Ukraine just before likely created more pressure than any phone call could.

And Trump claimed, "NO quid pro quo." But people who commit bribery and extortion rarely state the quid pro quo -- the "this for that" exchange -- explicitly. And Trump, by his own original statement, made clear he equates "corruption in Ukraine" with "investigate Biden" and little else: "All of the corruption taking place was largely the fact that we don't want our people like Vice President Biden and his son."

So, what crimes could Trump be violation of?

Foreign election aid -- as Trump should well know from the Mueller report, it is a crime to "solicit, accept or receive" a "thing of value" in connection with an election from a foreign national. By his own admission, Trump encouraged ("solicited") Ukraine to investigate Biden by allegedly dangling hundreds of millions of dollars in recently-suspended foreign aid.

While a criminal investigation does not carry a specific price tag, by any commonsense reading it is a "thing of value." And a criminal investigation of Biden would be extraordinarily helpful 2020 campaign fodder for Trump, more valuable than any yard sign or bumper sticker. Why else would Trump and his political flacks, such as personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, be so laser-focused on Biden, of all people -- who currently holds no public office but is a leading contender to take on Trump in the 2020 presidential election?

Bribery -- it is illegal for a public official "directly or indirectly" to demand, seek, receive or accept any "thing of value" in return for "being influenced in the performance of any official act." Here, again, a criminal investigation of Biden should qualify as a "thing of value" for the Trump 2020 campaign, which Trump plainly sought from Ukraine. The corresponding "influence in the performance of an official act" -- the quid pro quo -- is the delivery of foreign aid to Ukraine. Trump himself has drawn that link between foreign aid and Ukraine's efforts to root out "corruption." Trump has made clear that he equates "corruption" with the Biden investigation.

Extortion is the flip side of the bribery coin. Bribery is essentially "I'll help you, if you help me," while extortion is "I'll harm you, if you don't help me." The suspension of $400 million in aid to Ukraine just days before the call is the proverbial brick thrown through the plate glass window: Here's a taste of what'll happen if you don't comply.

Congress first must determine whether Trump committed a crime. If so, then impeachment is imperative. Even Trump's staunchest defenders would have difficulty arguing that he should remain in the White House if he committed a federal crime while in office.

But Congress cannot stop at the criminality question. Because even if Trump's conduct dodges the statutory raindrops and doesn't quite meet the definition of any federal crime, impeachment at its core is a remedy for abuse of constitutional power.

Impeachment need not be based on a crime. The Constitution prescribes impeachment for "treason, bribery, or high crimes and misdemeanors." But the term "high crimes and misdemeanors" is not defined anywhere in the Constitution or statute, and appears to be drawn from English parliamentary practice, which provided for impeachment for crimes or for conduct beyond established criminal law.

The Constitution separates impeachment from criminal prosecution. Draft articles of impeachment against President Richard Nixon included abuse of power and misuse of public office, while one of the proposed articles of impeachment against President Bill Clinton (voted down by the full House) related to abuse of power for non-criminal conduct. Fundamentally, impeachment is a political process with a political remedy (removal from office), while criminal charges address violations of law by imposing a punitive remedy (imprisonment and/or a fine).

This is where House Democrats have dropped the ball following the Mueller report. Because Mueller did not explicitly find that Trump committed criminal obstruction of justice -- given the Justice Department policy against indicting a sitting president -- Congress, reined in by Pelosi, has chosen not to make use of the political side of impeachment except for its minimal, superficial progress on a glacial impeachment inquiry.

Until now, Pelosi has stuck to her commitment not to pursue impeachment, instead offering up limp and hopeless legislative proposals. But Trump's conduct here is so flagrant, so lawless and so abusive that Pelosi is now changing course on impeachment.

By stepping up and seriously pursuing impeachment, House Democrats can salvage their legacy and meet their obligation to defend the Constitution against "all enemies, foreign and domestic."

Now, your questions

Lee, California: Does the House Intel Committee have a legal right to see the intelligence community whistleblower complaint about Trump?

On its face, the law is straightforward . If the Intelligence Community inspector general (IG) receives a complaint and deems it to be (1) of "urgent concern" and (2) "credible," then he or she "shall submit" the complaint to the congressional intelligence committees. In the Ukraine whistleblower case, the inspector general -- a Trump appointee -- reviewed the complaint and found that it raised an urgent concern and was credible, and should be submitted to Congress.

But that's when the director of National Intelligence (DNI) stepped in. After consulting with Attorney General William Barr's Justice Department, the DNI concluded that the IG should not forward the complaint to Congress because the President is not "a member of the Intelligence Community" and the conduct did not "involve an intelligence activity under the DNI's supervision." In other words, according to the DNI and Justice Department, the law does not apply to the President.

That appears to leave the DNI and Justice Department (on one hand) and the IG and Congress (on the other) at an impasse. Acting DNI Joseph Maguire is scheduled to testify in the House Intelligence Committee on Thursday. While there likely will be plenty of accusations and fireworks, do not expect the DNI and Congress suddenly to reach a mutual resolution. Instead, this dispute seems headed for the courts where, even in the best-case scenario, it will take months to resolve.

That said, there is nothing to prevent Congress from investigating even without the complaint in hand. While the whistleblower complaint could be important to Congress's investigation, Congress need not await the complaint's arrival before taking action.

Yvonne, Arizona: Some of the allegations about both President Donald Trump and Justice Brett Kavanaugh pertain to their conduct before taking office. Can an official be impeached based on conduct that occurred before the person was in office?

Yes. Article 1 of the Constitution explicitly grants the House the "sole power of impeachment" and the Senate "the sole power to try all impeachments," with no limitation on the time frame of the conduct that can form the basis for impeachment. Typically, where the Constitution contains no explicit limitation on a power, courts are reluctant to read in or impose such a restriction.

In fact, federal officials have been impeached for conduct predating their time in office. Most recently, in 2010, federal judge Thomas Porteus was impeached and convicted on various counts, some of which related to his conduct as a state judge (before joining the federal bench) and during his nomination and confirmation process. As a practical matter, it could be more difficult to rally political support for impeachment based on conduct before a subject took office, but legally there is no bar to it.

Craig, Canada: Does Congress have the authority to levy fines on witnesses who refuse to answer questions, like former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski?

As the Trump administration repeatedly contests and defies congressional subpoenas, House Democratic leaders have openly contemplated utilizing new enforcement mechanisms, including fines. However, there is no specific law on the books that gives Congress the right to levy fines and, in fact, nobody has ever been fined by Congress for defying a subpoena. But constitutional scholar Kia Rahnama convincingly argues that Congress's inherent enforcement powers likely include the power to impose fines.

While the current Congress could try to impose fines, there are major practical obstacles to actually collecting. First, there is enough legal uncertainty that the recipient of a fine could contest the issue in courts. It likely would take months to adjudicate the issue. Second, even if Congress did clearly have the power to fine a witness, I'd expect Lewandowski or other Trump loyalists to simply refuse to pay; much as Trump already has announced he will "fight all the subpoenas," he likely would fight all the fines. Congress would again have to go to the courts seeking an order requiring the witness to pay up.

Essentially, if Congress tried to force Lewandowski to pay a fine, I'd expect him to respond, "Make me." Congress ultimately might succeed, but not without a long and bruising legal fight that likely would detract from its core investigative and oversight mission.

Three questions to watch

1) Will Pelosi finally see the light and permit her caucus to move forward on impeachment?

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. Watch Honig answer reader questions on "CNN Newsroom with Ana Cabrera" at 5:40 p.m. ET Sundays.

(CNN) Of all the norms -- and arguably laws -- that President Donald Trump has trampled during his time in office, few have done more damage than his habitual politicization of the Justice Department. Trump has made clear time and again that he views the Justice Department not as a beacon of truth and independence, but rather as a dedicated hit squad, tasked with carrying out his fleeting political whims and taking vengeance on his p ersonal and political enemies .

As recently as Monday, Trump bizarrely exhorted the House Judiciary Committee to investigate former President Barack Obama's book deal and "all the deals made by the Dems in Congress" -- citing no violation of any law by the suggested targets (who happen to be his political adversaries).

Trump's reaction to new sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, reported by the New York Times , sets a new low. (CNN is not reporting the details of the story, because it has not been able to independently verify them yet.) By beseeching the Justice Department to "rescue" Kavanaugh, Trump promotes an ignorant and dangerous view of what the Justice Department is, and is not, about. Meanwhile, Kavanaugh has always maintained his innocence, and a Supreme Court spokeswoman said Kavanaugh had no comment on the new allegation against the justice.

It is not clear what exactly Trump has in mind, but as a Justice Department alum, I know this: the Justice Department does not "rescue" people who have been repeatedly accused of sexual assault. Nor should the Justice Department throw its enormous power into partisan battles to settle a political score. And it is anathema to the Justice Department's core mission to suggest that it use its breathtaking might to silence the media or to intimidate victims and witnesses who might have credible evidence relevant to an allegation.

The Justice Department's highest function is the discovery of truth, without fear or favor to politics or power dynamics. In Kavanaugh's case, that core truth-finding function may have been badly compromised from the start. Senator Chris Coons reportedly sent a letter -- now obtained by CNN -- to the FBI during its 2018 investigation of alleged sexual misconduct, urging the FBI to follow up with one particular alleged witness "who had key information about alleged misconduct by the nominee while at Yale," according to CNN's reporting.

According to The New York Times, that witness was never contacted, though an aide familiar with the letter told CNN that the FBI acknowledged receipt of Coons' letter at the time, but the senator never heard more beyond that. And CNN has reported that the FBI took cues on its investigation from the White House, which -- sources told CNN -- directed the FBI to keep the investigation "as narrow as possible."

Meanwhile, in October 2018, after Christine Blasey Ford testified and the FBI investigation was complete, Senate Judiciary Committee Chair Charles Grassley crowed in bold font on his webpage that "there is no corroboration of the allegations" of sexual assault against Kavanaugh. And a former Grassley staffer defended the truncated investigation in The Washington Post this weekend, claiming his office never heard from a man now raising a new allegation, and it would not have mattered if they did. Here's a little something I picked up during my 14 years as a prosecutor: you'll never find corroboration if you intentionally try not to look for it.

Kavanaugh almost certainly is not going anywhere (see below for more on this). He likely will sit on the Supreme Court for decades to come, certainly for as long as he wishes. But Kavanaugh's deeply flawed confirmation process should stand as a reminder of the danger of turning the Justice Department, long fearless and proudly independent, into an institutional political operative.

Now, your questions:

Hunter, Minnesota: What specific steps can be taken to force the removal or impeachment of Kavanaugh?

Under our Constitution , all federal judges "shall hold their offices during good behavior" -- meaning that a federal judge's term can end in only three ways: the judge's death, resignation or impeachment.

Indeed, although impeachment is commonly associated with presidents, other federal officials including judges can also be impeached. The requirements are the same for judges as for presidents: a majority vote to impeach in the House followed by a two-thirds vote in the Senate for conviction and removal. Fifteen federal judges have been impeached in US history, most recently in 2010 when district court Judge G. Thomas Porteous was impeached by the House and convicted in the Senate for bribery and perjury.

Kavanaugh was confirmed by the Senate in October 2018 by a 50-48 vote, including 49 Republican votes for confirmation. That means that even if the Democratic-majority House votes to impeach Kavanaugh, at least 19 Senators who voted to confirm him last year must change their minds and vote to convict and remove him now. The odds of that happening are infinitesimal.

That said, there are important issues that Congress can and should explore about Kavanaugh's confirmation process and the investigation of various sexual assault allegations. Most importantly: who made the decision to limit the FBI's investigation, and why?

John, California: Does the House Judiciary Committee's recent resolution give the committee any additional legal authority to compel witnesses and evidence?

On a surface level, the House Judiciary Committee's resolution establishes procedures for an impeachment inquiry. And the very existence of the resolution itself should strengthen the committee's legal hand in court battles over disputed witnesses (including former White House counsel Don McGahn) and other evidence. For example, in the ongoing court battle over grand jury materials from special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, House Democrats must establish that they need the evidence pursuant to a "judicial proceeding;" now Democrats can point to their impeachment inquiry to satisfy that legal requirement.

The Trump administration, however, has turned House Democrats' own public indecisiveness against them. In the Mueller grand jury case, the Justice Department has argued that the impeachment effort remains "hypothetical," citing in support of its argument House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's public statements that the investigation is not a true impeachment proceeding and that Democrats recently were "nowhere close" to such a move.

So, while the Judiciary Committee's impeachment inquiry resolution could and should help its cause in legal proceedings, the lack of a consistent, coordinated public message could blunt any impact, and might even ultimately undermine the efforts of House Democrats to compel necessary witnesses and evidence.

William, Virginia: What does it mean when a judge finds that a person does not have "standing" to bring a lawsuit?

"Standing" is the fundamental notion in our legal system that a person or entity can bring a lawsuit only if it holds an actual, direct interest in a dispute. In other words, people cannot sue simply because they have some academic interest in a case or are displeased with something that is happening in public life. Rather, a plaintiff must be able to show what the law calls an "injury in fact" -- for example, some physical injury, financial loss or contractual violation.

Several lawsuits challenging the Trump administration's actions have stumbled over the standing hurdle. For example, a federal Court of Appeals in Washington DC recently dismissed an emoluments lawsuit brought by several state attorneys general who argued that hotels in their states lost business to the Trump International Hotel because foreign government officials and other state leaders choose to stay there to appease the President. The court found this argument too attenuated, and the alleged financial harm too far removed from the attorney generals who brought the suit, to satisfy the standing requirement.

But a different federal Court of Appeals based in New York last week reinstated a separate emoluments lawsuit brought by a private ethics organization and a group of restaurant and hotel owners, which previously had been dismissed for lack of standing. This court found that the injury suffered directly by the hotel and restaurant owners -- loss of business to a Trump-owned hotel -- was direct and concrete enough to sustain the lawsuit.

There is some, but not much, daylight between the Washington DC and New York decisions. There is a legally significant difference between attorneys general (who cannot allege any direct harm to them) and restaurant and hotel owners (who can). But it also could be that the two court of appeals decisions cannot be reconciled -- after all, the job of state attorneys general is to protect and if necessary sue on behalf of the citizens of their states, so what's the difference between a restaurant owner suing or an attorney general suing on his behalf? If so, then the cases could wind up before the ultimate arbiter: the US Supreme Court.

Three questions to watch:

1) When former Trump campaign chair Corey Lewandowski testifies in Congress on Tuesday, will he offer firsthand evidence of obstruction of justice by Trump or will he expose Mueller's investigation as a "witch hunt," as he has vowed to do?

2) Will we see the Justice Department Inspector General's report on the origins of the Russia investigation, which reportedly is in the final phases of internal review? <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

My 54-year-old patient was alone in the intensive care unit, with no family or friends in his life. He slumped in his bed, gasping, staring up at me. Admitted with lung fibrosis and pneumonia, he had scars and infection aggressively replacing his airways, despite our best treatments.

As a newly minted doctor years ago, my mind was usually occupied with beeps and buzzers providing me technical information to help calculate choices about patients' care. Having developed gray hair over many years at the bedside, my first priority is now more straightforward: to hear the voices of the vulnerable people looking up at me from their bed. That is what I try to do as a physician, including, of course, what they tell me in the silences.

I pulled a chair next to his bed so we could talk at eye level. His face was blank. "I want euthanasia. I'm going to die soon, so what's the point of living longer? I'm just wasted space."

I felt nauseated. The illegality of euthanasia was not what ran through my mind. Instead I thought about how Paul had lost his sense of personhood. I thought about how I had chosen to become a doctor in the first place.

I chose medicine as my calling after a childhood spent in the Deep South: Shreveport, Louisiana. My mother taught English there after my father, an engineer, had left her for another woman. I remember it was so hot that my siblings and I would fry eggs on the sidewalk. No joke. On most days, we'd walk to a nearby bayou and catch baby alligators for fun and fill up coolers with crawfish for dinner. That last part is important because we had no money at all. Dad wouldn't pay anything to Mom, who didn't make much as a teacher. So I started working at the farm of a man who wanted to marry my mother. I worked 14-hour days from about five in the morning doing square bales of hay until seven at night picking vegetables and running the country store.

While I cherish those years and the formation that grueling work provided, I was determined to do something different with my life. Mom told me that Dad had loved math and science, and she taught literature. So I figured it must come naturally for me to split the difference and do something with people, science and the arts. To me, that meant medicine.

Dr. Wes Ely assessing a patient in the Medical Intensive Care Unit at Vanderbilt.

I remember our first big assignment in sixth grade was to write a research paper on what we would be when we grew up. I rode my beat-up bicycle to the local library and began reading about how to become a physician: What was the process and what would it all mean? I walked out of the library that day having spent most of my time reading a long medical essay about truth. The author insisted that to be a physician, one has constantly to seek truth about the patient's diagnosis, the best treatment, and the best way to serve each and every person. What I learned from the essay was that truth doesn't change depending on our ability to stomach it. As I progressed through Jesuit high school and Tulane, this became a common theme in my pursuit of a life as a doctor: "Wrong is wrong even if everybody is wrong. Right is right even if nobody is right." Numerous people are credited with some version of this quote, from actors to philosophers to theologians. That sense of truth drove my study and training and my realization that each person's life has value beyond measure.

I knew long before I met Paul that I couldn't kill another person just because he or she wanted me to, but I still had to find a way to respond to Paul's request to die.

'Just don't abandon me'

My response came in parts over my days with him. First, I explained that, as his physician, I wanted to be with him through the dying process. I told him that I considered us to be in a mutual covenant. We both had a degree of autonomy that had to be respected, but I would never intentionally harm him. "Paul, our covenant includes my limiting your suffering," I said. "You are the best judge of when you need more meds for pain, anxiety and breathing. All of us will work day and night to end your distress, but we won't deliberately end your life."

With our eyes locked, Paul gave his instruction: "Just don't abandon me." And we sat there, as partners.

As a physician, there is no better place to be. Perhaps especially amid the uncertainty, we must learn to partner with each person in the bonds of this two-way relationship. He in need of help and me in need of helping.

Paul was receiving excellent palliative care for his physical symptoms, but it wasn't enough. It never is. Emotional isolation and despair can cast a shadow darker than disease. Physicians fail our patients on a human level. We forget that our patients are more than the sum of their medical conditions, so I asked Paul about other types of therapy — art, music, spirituality, pets, sunshine — that might help him.

'He who has a "why" to live can bear almost any "how"'

"I want my music. Can you get me the soundtrack for 'Lord of the Rings'?" Within minutes we had the songs playing in his room, and his demeanor changed from desolate to alert and engaged. "I love music. It's always been a motivator, but now ... I don't know." He shifted in his bed. "My goals are gone."

Nietzsche's words came to my mind, "He who has a 'why' to live can bear almost any 'how.'"

Viktor Frankl , as a physician-survivor of Auschwitz, used Nietzsche's quote four times in his crucial analysis, "Man's Search for Meaning." I think this book should be required reading for medical students.

As with many patients, Paul's story needed unpacking. "Paul, what did you do in life?"

He smiled and shrugged. "I'm a rare beast: a plumber who acts. I do Shakespeare festivals. You know, 'The quality of mercy is not strained.' I've been mulling over that line. Years ago I didn't understand it. I do now. Mercy should not be forced. It's better as a natural infusion, one person to another."

I described for Paul the many years I spent alongside my single-mom-turned-Shakespeare-director, helping her cue actors. As we talked, I watched his erratic oxygen levels fall and then partially recover, obliging us to take breaks. Sweat would build up on his forehead, and, more than once, I worried that our conversation was too much of a strain. But we were unpacking, and it was essential.

The quality of mercy

That night I asked Christine, a nurse who loves theater, to sit and talk with Paul. Soon their lives were interwoven, too.

"I think I helped Christine," Paul said the next day. "My own illness made me forget that one of my 'things' is seeing when someone is hurting. And Christine is. She came to help me, but it turns out some really personal things in our background are weirdly similar. I told her my way through the worst of it." He paused, his thoughts far away.

It seemed like a good time to return to his previous request. "Paul, you've asked for euthanasia, and you brought up Portia's line from 'Merchant of Venice' about mercy. Can we talk about these things?" He nodded, and closed his eyes.

"We all want to be here with you in your suffering. I want your opinion: I don't think injecting you with a lethal drug would be truly merciful, but it would, in every sense of the word, be 'strained.' It would be a forced and unnatural 'false' mercy. Whenever possible, mercy must also be lifting and healing. I don't want to abandon those key elements in serving you."

His eyes opened wide. "Doc, talking with you and Christine about life's best and worst times has helped." He took a deep breath, and I heard the whoosh of high-flow oxygen into his nostrils. "Things I confided to Christine are helping her sort through her own struggles. She said she's coming back tonight, and that means the world to me." Then, unwittingly, Paul paraphrased Nietzsche: "When we met, I was afraid of being a burden and not mattering. Now I feel different. I'm not a believer like others, but I guess I remembered the 'why' to live."

Short of a war zone, there are few settings as raw as an ICU. Yet treasured moments of human transformation come when people like Paul rediscover their "why," even if just for an hour or a day.

'I'm glad I didn't miss this time'

I see many paths toward survival in the ICU, and for non-survivors, myriad paths toward death: sudden, prolonged, stuttering, reluctant, stoical -- and these paths are dynamic, not static.

It is a rare patient who asks me for euthanasia, but it is nearly universal that dying patients seek help with suffering. Sitting on their beds brings me right up against their fears, the greatest of which is usually not intolerable pain.

Lack of control is what bothers people the most, and it drives most requests for euthanasia, which is predominantly a first-world phenomenon. As we have gained more and more ability to dictate so many aspects of our lives, looking ahead in uncertainty has become something people are not willing to tolerate. As a physician, I find this is a very important "teachable moment" for most patients: helping them (and me) to live in the moment. Whitewashed along a wall in the home for destitute and dying in Kolkata, these words of Saint Mother Teresa became emblazoned in my mind, and I recalled them for Paul: "Yesterday is gone. Tomorrow has not yet come. We have only today. Let us begin." He nodded in agreement.

Paul reminded me that the best remedy for angst is human relationship and community.

The problem with assisted suicide and euthanasia for Paul — and for others — is that it presented him with an illusion of 'cure,' when in reality it would have left him devoid of the healing he received.

And alongside the patient, of course, sits the physician. The problem for me with intentionally administering lethal medications to end the life of another person is that it would rob me as a healer. I would be qualitatively changed. If I were ever to assume that I had authority over life to take it deliberately, it would, for me, create an irrevocable cavern of emptiness. The infinite worth of every person outprices autonomy: What you and I want is less important than who we are.

Obviously, the approach I took with Paul won't be an answer for everyone, yet it is too often left untried. Some will say Paul's story is merely an uplifting anecdote. Nevertheless, I hope to embrace the lessons I learned at his bedside for most of my patients, and I hope my colleagues do the same.

We are sent to heal even when cure is not possible. What we should be trying to heal is often not physical disease or clinical depression, but a person's sense of insignificance and hopelessness, which we cannot heal by eliminating the person.

Paul died a week later. By then he realized his life was of value even with a terminal disease. In fact, the last thing he said to me, between gasps, was: "I'm glad I didn't miss this time. I never saw it coming, Doc. ... In losing my breath, I gained it."

This piece is the second part of a CNN Opinion series, " What it's like to be me ," which explores the personal struggles Americans face at a time of profound social change. Rebecca Cokley is a senior fellow at the Center for American Progress, where she works on disability policy. Formerly, she was the executive director of the National Council on Disability and served in the Obama administration in the Administration for Community Living and the Presidential Personnel Office, where she was responsible for outreach to diversity and minority organizations. The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers.

(CNN) I was lying on the cold metal table in the operating room in the midst of giving birth to my second child, in what had been a totally normal and uneventful pregnancy, when the anesthesiologist assigned to my C-section suggested that my obstetrician might want to tie my tubes. He didn't ask me. He didn't even acknowledge that I was there, though I was in a ragged state of consciousness. He said, "While you're down there, we are going to go ahead and tie her tubes, right?"

At a time when I was most vulnerable, a medical professional thought it was a good suggestion, an acceptable notion, to make an assumption with this level of this importance for me. My doctor, my husband, and I all responded unanimously: "No!"

As upsetting as that moment was, it was not at all surprising to be treated as less than fully human. Professionally, I work as an advocate for the disabled. But I also know from 39 years of life as a little person, situations like these are such a clear indication that we aren't seen as whole people. No matter what we do, what we achieve, the nondisabled world will largely always see us as less than, as separate.

The delivery room wasn't my first experience with ignorance around disability and family. It wasn't always perfect for me growing up. My high school guidance counselor told me point blank, "Kids like you don't go here, you go to the special school." If it weren't for the teachers, whom I loved, I easily could have fallen into a different path because of how that counselor treated me.

I think about that, as I prepare to give birth again in a few months, to a boy who may be of average size. If he is, his mother and two siblings may always be "different" in a way that he is not.

When he comes, I'll be having another C-section. Little people can only deliver that way, as our pelvic area is not large enough to deliver vaginally, so I've always had an anesthesiologist present for the entire procedure. General anesthesia is hard on those of us with dwarfism as well, because of how our faces are shaped and complexities in our airways, and spinal anesthesia, including epidurals, can also be hard depending on any spinal issues. For a long time the only option was putting us completely out, as was done with my mom during my delivery.

With my last delivery, I was already in a bad place with this anesthesiologist -- who was in a position of medical authority (even though he wasn't ultimately in control of my treatment) and somehow thought my right to have more children was his business. I had asked him to review the notes from my first C-section and my MRIs to make sure he felt confident he could do the job. But he failed, because the spinal block wore off halfway through the surgery and he had to help to determine alternate means of sedation -- which resulted in him giving me a low level of general anesthesia to complete the procedure.

I don't know for sure why he suggested I be sterilized, but I can only assume that he thought I should be medically prevented from having more kids because, like my children Jackson and Kaya, I was born with dwarfism. I've asked multiple nondisabled friends who have had the same anesthesiologist and none reported him making any remarks indicating he felt the same way about their right to bear children.

While I grew up in the Bay Area, I now live in Washington, D.C., with my husband and kids. Professionally and personally, being a little person is central to who I am, but it's also one among many ways that I see and make sense of the world. For better and for worse, being different is hugely significant in my life, individually and with my family. And I think we should be more open with all kids about how being different can be a good thing, an important thing.

Part of the legacy of the landmark 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act is that it's easier for people with disabilities to become parents. It's natural to assume that once people with disabilities have remedies for discrimination and greater access to society, they'll do exactly what a lot of nondisabled people do: get married and have kids. This was always a logical conclusion to me, as both my parents were little people (which is rare -- 80% of people with dwarfism are the only person in their families with it).

Growing up with a disability

My parents met in 1970 at a convention of Little People of America, an organization founded by actor Billy Barty in 1957 to provide support and information to people with dwarfism and their families. There are chapters around the world , affiliates internationally, and annual conventions that bring together around 2,000 people in different cities every year.

My dad ran a Center for Independent Living for people with disabilities and my mom ran a disabled student center at a local community college, so I grew up in the Bay Area surrounded by people with all different types of disabilities.

I also grew up in an environment where expectations of me were set high, by my family and by a strong network of supporters and allies. My mom went back to school for her bachelor's and master's degrees when I was around 8 or 9, as a re-entry student at the College of San Mateo and the College of Notre Dame, respectively.

Rebecca and Patrick Cokley with their two kids

I was a typical presence with her on campus, sitting in the back taking notes along with the other students (I was always nerdy). I remember getting in long discussions with one of the professors, who was a nun, about Kevin Smith's latest film, "Dogma," and her asking me to write a paper on it while I was still in junior high school.

It took a long time for me to realize that the experiences I had growing up, becoming an adult, and starting my own family were not always the norm -- and that the work of achieving acceptance for those with disabilities was far from over.

All my life I wanted to work in civil rights, and found myself thinking of being a civil rights lawyer from an early age. I think having parents who were so civically engaged was a key piece of this, as was growing up in the San Francisco Bay Area during the onset of the AIDS epidemic. I remember that in the early days when it was still stigmatized as the "gay cancer," my parents and I attended so many funerals. And at so many of them we were the only people there, minus a friend or two.

I asked my mom why we had to go (my 6 year old brain was much more focused on getting to the mall to go ice skating at the time) and I remember my mom telling me, "We're here because no one deserves to have no one stand for them. They're no different from us. We are here for the reason that someday, if something like this happens to our community, we'd hope they would be here for us."

And I think in so many ways, that comment, while in passing, became my true north.

'Mom, I think I want to be a clown'

When I was 10, my dad passed away in his sleep after confronting health issues for years and using a wheelchair most of my life after a fall. Soon after, my mom took me to the Ringling Brothers circus. We were in the parking lot leaving the Cow Palace when I turned to my mom and said the seven words she had feared her entire life. "Mom, I think I want to be clown." She slammed on the brakes so hard I thought my head would hit the dashboard. "What?" she asked.

"Yeah, I think I want to be a clown." We rode home in silence. I didn't realize at the time, but this was a huge crisis of faith for her. All I had ever talked about at that point was fighting injustice and here I was telling her I wanted to take on a role that focused on little people not being taken seriously.

I later learned that she broke down in tears with a group of fellow graduate students, telling them she had failed as a parent. A few weeks later, I told her I only wanted to be a clown because clowns traveled the world, and that I had returned to my senses and decided to be a civil rights attorney again. It was an important lesson in the importance of having high expectations and being flexible that would serve me repeatedly throughout my career and as a mom.

Because of my passion for civil rights, my parents introduced me at a young age to Paul Steven Miller , an up-and-coming attorney and little person who worked in Los Angeles. Miller went on to be the first little person to work in the White House, under President Clinton, and when he found out my love of reading, would routinely send me case briefs to read "for fun."

My mom and dad thought it was important that I knew people like me doing the work I wanted to do. I got to return the favor in 2007, when I recruited my mentor Miller for the Barack Obama campaign and ended up following in his footsteps by taking a job at the White House in 2010.

Taking this path was important to me -- and to my family as well.

When it came time to go to college, I started out at the same school where my mom had gone. I studied in London during my sophomore year of high school. It was an incredible experience. Not only for all the amazing things that London offered, but also because manners often trumped the notion of treating disabled people in public like a sideshow. I didn't have to worry about tourists taking photos of me, or having "midget midget" shouted at me in a bar, as had happened to me in the United States.

Returning home, I accepted a full scholarship to the University of Santa Cruz, where I decided to go into political science and study with professors like Wendy Mink, Peter Euben, and Angela Davis.

My first two jobs after college really shaped my life. One was an internship with my local member of Congress, Rep. Tom Lantos , the only member of the House of Representatives who was a Holocaust survivor. He and his staff were hugely supportive of my passion for civil rights and it managed to keep my feet in the area of politics while I also worked at my second job -- at Victoria's Secret. I started as a part-time holiday hire and was quickly promoted to credit and bra specialist lead before becoming a co-manager.

You may wonder what politics and lingerie have in common. I always sum it up as, "You have to make someone want something they don't need and want to pay too much for it."

My boss at Victoria's Secret had grown up next door to a family of little people who had offered her stability in a childhood that had little, so it was nice to not have to go into a job where I'd have to prove myself just as capable as a nondisabled person. I think being a person with a physical disability working at the most image conscious company in the world actually made me more approachable to a lot of customers and also made me want to help folks who may have felt nervous or uncomfortable in the store.

I think the funniest thing was how customers would describe me when checking out. They'd actively fumble their words and body around trying to describe me without saying I was a little person. "Ummmmm, the girl in the black suit." (We all wore black suits). "Well, she's petite." (There were a number of us who were.) My sales associates were comfortable with me being a little person but the customers were very concerned about being rude or just not knowing what to say in general.

The experience did make me more conscious about my safety, because I had a few strange customers who would follow me around in the store or who would act like they were "fascinated" with me. One couple in particular went too far and made a point of repeatedly telling me, "We could pick you up and walk out with you. We'd take you home and make you a button in our mattress. No one could physically stop us." I think as a little person you tend to get a heightened "spidey sense" because of how people treat you, and that experience definitely set mine off. But on the whole my customers were kind and thankful for my help.

Doing political and public policy work was still my dream, though, and in 2004, I moved to Washington to take a job working in education policy. A mentor of mine persuaded me to come and work for the National Collaborative on Workforce and Disability/Youth . I learned a ton working there, and it was there that I also met my amazing husband, Patrick. He says he noticed me right away -- cautioning himself not to come off as creepy by "staring at the new girl." I have no memory of this.

Building a family

Today, our family exists at multiple crossroads.

Patrick is average height and African-American. I'm a little person. Our two kids are both little people. My husband has a vision impairment, so I'm the driver in the family, but, usually, new average-height people we meet assume he's the driver. Like many D.C. couples, we met at work.

Rebbeca Hare and Patrick Cokley were married at St. Luke's Episcopal Church, Columbia.

When having our own children, it was interesting how our friends reacted to our news. Our LP (that's how those of us in the community refer to "little people") friends all automatically assumed the baby would be a little person; we see it as a marker of cultural pride. Our average height friends didn't ask me about whether the baby would be LP or average height -- they'd ask Patrick, and he would typically respond that he didn't care either way.

I worked at the White House when I was pregnant and had our first child, Jackson. To him, it was routine to head back to the office with me after pickup so I could keep working. In Barack Obama's White House, it never felt weird or out-of-place being the mother of African-American kids with disabilities who were on a first-name basis with senior White House officials. To quote the boss himself, "I believe that this country succeeds when everyone gets a fair shot, when everyone does their fair share, when everyone plays by the same rules." And those are really the values that we stress as we're raising Jackson and his younger sister, Kaya.

At age 6, Jackson's awareness of the world is growing. One day, he came home from kindergarten and said, "Mom, you're white, Dad's black, and I'm peach." His dad turned around and said "Peach? You're black." Jackson pointed to his arm, shook his head, and said "Peach!" This made us realize that we needed to discuss our kids and their heritage much more than we had been.

We've purposely stayed in the D.C. area because there is a thriving chapter of Little People of America here and I want my children to grow up with a strong tie to that community. It's important for them to have friends who are other LPs, have teen and young adult LPs to look up to, and to know LP adults.

Since we're raising children who also identify as African-American, it is imperative to Patrick and me that they have strong people in the black community to look up to and relate to. We are blessed with a cadre of aunties and uncles and cousins who are biological and chosen family members from my husband's childhood, his time at Howard University, and our various circles of friends. As a white woman, I have to be aware that my daughter in particular is going to have questions that I can't -- and in some cases, shouldn't -- be the one to answer.

As a professional advocate, I've spent the last few years working on issues tied to police killings of African-Americans with disabilities. Unarmed people of color whose names you may know because their deaths involved the police -- Eric Garner , Natasha McKinnon, Sandra Bland -- were also all people with disabilities, many of whom disclosed their disabilities to law enforcement and still died.

Rebecca Cokley and President Obama pose for a snapshot.

Raising two African-American children with disabilities, I understand that some of the very qualities that endear them to people now -- their curiosity, their feeling that they've never met a stranger, their trust in the world -- could be the very same things that could potentially put them in danger. So we have to talk about these things, because while the bubble of our home provides safety and security, the outside world is a different place.

My children have grown up knowing chosen family members who have been assaulted by law enforcement. It broke my heart to have to talk to my son about this, but we also couldn't keep it from him.

Parenthood and activism: our forms of protest in the world

When the anesthesiologist suggested that my doctor sterilize me, what I heard was someone with medical authority basically telling another person with medical authority that I shouldn't be having any more children. I was certainly angry, but not surprised. Many of us in the disability community know this feeling all too well . Whether it's forced sterilization, experimentation, eugenics, or treatments to keep us small and manageable, removing our right to control our bodies, our personhood, has been common practice by the "well-meaning" nondisabled public for centuries.

No amount of education, of mentors, or of amazingly supportive workplaces would have prepared me for this level of discrimination. Yet this is what many disabled people encounter as parents.

Under the law in dozens of states, children can be removed from their homes based solely on a parent's disability. In my work as an advocate, I've spoken with a dyslexic mom who lost her kids when pharmacists thought she would misread instructions and overmedicate them, and a father who lost his kids when a ball rolled into the street and he wheeled his chair to the curb, always in control, to help the kid retrieve it and a neighbor saw.

If not denied personhood outright, we tend to get our personhood policed by rhetoric and language. Nondisabled people routinely refer to us using euphemisms like "special needs," "differently abled," or, in a pun on language from the past, "handi-capable."

These aren't words anyone like me (meaning disabled) came up with -- they were defined by society because the concept of "disability" makes nondisabled people feel uncomfortable. It's a reminder that yes, we are different.

Rebecca and Patrick Cokley and their kids in their Washington neighborhood.

But as I like to remind people, disability is written into civil rights laws, so by teaching young people that "disability" is something to be ashamed of -- say, by implying that someone shouldn't have more children because of one -- society is, in fact, disconnecting them from their civil rights. We didn't celebrate the 27th anniversary of the "Americans with Special Needs Act" this summer, after all.

The disability community continues to struggle with media and interest-group narratives that frame us as victims or takers. The ongoing health care fight by the disability-rights group ADAPT -- with its images of Americans in wheelchairs protesting proposed cuts to Medicaid and being removed by Capitol Police -- and others was a powerful moment in our movement. And while the public reacted with outrage at disabled people being abused by law enforcement, I have to wonder if nondisabled people really knew just what the protesters with disabilities, including our friend Steph Woodward, whose image became synonymous with this activism for a time, were really fighting for.

They were fighting for their very lives, their right to determine where they wanted to live -- in this case, in their communities rather than being forcibly institutionalized in nursing homes. They are strong, but were still fighting and being framed as victims

We talk about this a lot in our home, about the issues affecting the intersecting oppressions we encounter, whether ableism, racism or sexism. It's impossible not to -- and we would be irresponsible if we didn't.

We also spend a lot of time talking to my kids about consent. People often act as though disabled people don't have a right to bodily autonomy. When I attended the women's march in D.C. in January, I was repeatedly grabbed and manhandled by women who wanted to know where was my mommy and why didn't I know better than to wander away from her. They all looked shocked when I responded, "I am the mommy," but not a single one apologized to me.

As little people, we also deal with the public taking photos and videos of us without our consent. I want my children to understand how to navigate the world safely but at the same time feel like they can speak up when someone is treating them wrong or in a way that makes them uncomfortable.

Patrick and I are now expecting our third child. As of yet, we don't know if he will be a little person or an average height child, though so far, it looks like he will be the latter. But we don't care either way.

What matters to us, as we anticipate the joy and sleepless nights ahead, is that our family is growing again.

Sarah Lenti is a political strategist and policy advisor at SML Advisory Partners. She served as a director on the National Security Council under Condoleezza Rice and worked as a lead researcher for Mitt Romney's 2010 book, "No Apology: The Case for American Greatness." The views expressed in this commentary are her own. This piece is the first of a CNN Opinion series, " What it's like to be me ," which explores the personal struggles Americans face at a time of profound social change.

Denver (CNN) It was a year ago when a young woman stopped me in a neighborhood shop. She gazed at my stroller and started crying. She told me how lucky I was to be married with kids.

My heart dropped. She didn't know me at all.

I am a single mother by choice. Yet I was raised in a Christian, conservative home, where I grew up believing in the traditional family unit. And I was taught that there was an order to achieving it. First, fall in love. Second, marry a man. Third, start a family.

Now in my fifth decade, only one has proven true for me -- and it isn't the first.

On the day that I turned 30, I journaled that I would think about becoming a mother should I still be single at 38. What that looked like, I didn't exactly know. It was a promise to myself, maybe to God.

At the time, I was in a terrible relationship with a man who told me he wanted to be with me, but he could never love me. It was because of those words that I first clung to the idea of motherhood. Maybe a man could deny me love, but he would never deny me a child.

Fast forward to my 38th birthday. I was still single, and the world of dating had changed significantly in the last eight years. Tinder and Bumble, the dominant dating apps, offered countless options for single men and women, but made the experience of dating entirely impersonal.

Every family is different: Share your story of how IVF, adoption or your unique family structure has shaped your life with #ToBeMe or text/WhatsApp us on +1-347-322-0415

Dating amounted to small talk with a stranger, who you had briefly interfaced with online because you each thought the other attractive. The small talk was a prelude to hooking up, and there were no expectations even of a text the next day.

It was brutal. And after trying my hand at it, I was no closer to finding the love of my life or starting a family.

If I needed statistics to back me up, I had them. In 2014, marriage was on the decline, as was the fertility rate in the United States.

I had one real option left -- and that was to attempt to get pregnant alone.

Maybe I didn't deserve a family, or so many of the subscribers to my conservative Christian values might say. And maybe the men with whom I had been involved didn't view me as acceptable wife/mother material.

But deep down I felt differently and decided to give myself one shot.

And so I started the process of in vitro fertilization (IVF). I was mentally prepared for the physical havoc that would ensue, and I had saved every penny for it -- to the tune of $30,000.

Tinder and Bumble, the dominant dating apps, offered countless options for single men and women, but made the experience of dating entirely impersonal.

But why didn't I adopt? After all, even if I were fortunate enough to have a child, the child would be fatherless. And many, myself included, believe this places the child in a precarious situation.

That said, at least with IVF my potential child would be biologically related to me, his or her grandparents and cousins. The child might not have a father, but he or she would have a strong bloodline. I hoped this would help ease any future struggle for my child.

The IVF experience

The very decade I was born into -- the glorious 70's -- ushered in the science and technology that might allow me to conceive. Alone.

More specifically, 1978 was the year that the first human being was born through the process of embryo creation outside of the womb, then implantation inside of the womb, pregnancy and successful birth. Since that time, IVF has produced approximately 5 million babies , with nearly 1 million of those being born in the United States.

The IVF pool is quite minuscule compared to total US births -- for example, in 2011, only 0.7% of all US births were attributed to IVF. That said, and barely optimistic, I was committed to the process, or so I thought.

And yet there I was at a bar in Los Angeles, a month out from IVF, crying in front of two people I barely knew, but knew well enough to unload to.

My life was great on paper. I had done all the right things. I went to Stanford for graduate school. I worked at the White House under Condoleezza Rice. I had the opportunity to travel the world. I had loving parents and two wonderful sisters.

And yet I felt unloved -- even unlovable. And also greatly conflicted.

On the one hand, I was ecstatic -- I was weeks away from my shot at becoming a biological mom. I started thinking about this potential path nine years ago and had been setting aside money for five years. I was in love with idea of having a family and giddy at the thought of the unknown.

But there was doubt. Goodness, there was doubt. There was that little voice inside my head -- the voice of my parents and others -- that was very much alive in me. "Why would you purposely bring a child into the world without a father? Are you really that lonely? How would that child feel one day?"

Throughout my upbringing, I was told that it's wrong to play God. And, as recently as the previous Christmas Eve, I was told that bringing a child into the world without a father was selfish.

My heart and my brain had to fight back.

No, I was not that lonely. No, I was not that selfish. Actually, it was waking up single, every single day of my life -- only to be greeted by my career -- that felt selfish. And while I could never speak for the feelings that my future child might have, I took solace in the belief that any child would be happy to be alive if he or she were sincerely loved.

Throughout my upbringing, I was told that it's wrong to play God. And, as recently as the previous Christmas Eve, I was told that bringing a child into the world without a father was selfish.

As I drew nearer to the implantation date, the prospect of creating a tiny human grew more real and began to override any lingering doubt.

And so, on August 29, 2014, I asked my doctor to implant two embryos. He wisely asked me to justify two. I was quick to answer. If I were lucky enough to get pregnant with twins -- what a gift for them. They may not have a father, but they would always have each other.

I knew the statistics and did not expect to get pregnant. Given my age and the means of conception, I was praying for the long shot of one, knowing two would be a miracle.

The 2014 Assisted Reproductive Technology National Summary Report, as published by the US Department of Health and Human Services, is a humbling reminder of just how small the odds were during the year that I attempted to conceive. In 2014, a woman of my age, using fresh non-donor eggs with no previous pregnancies, had an 18.8% chance of pregnancy resulting in a live birth. When it came to percentages of cycles resulting in twin lives births, the success rate plummeted to 3.7%.

Yes, I had a 3.7% chance of success.

Choosing a donor

Of course, before the IVF process could begin, I had to choose a donor -- and let's just say I took a less than conventional approach.

Given my professional background as a conservative politico, I think people expect me to say that IQ, number of educational degrees and political association were at the top of my donor qualifications list. Not the case.

I was looking for someone who I would be attracted to if we were procreating in the traditional way.

I know this must sound incredibly superficial. But, let's be frank, it's impossible to gauge true intellect or a kind heart by virtue of an online donor search.

And so I began my search with a focus on the physical attributes that I have always been attracted to -- namely height and athleticism. Six-foot-2 and toned was my baseline.

The donor was a collegiate lacrosse athlete. I was able to see three pictures, from tot to teen, of an adorable boy with an incredible smile, unruly hair and a twinkle in his eyes. (This particular bank did not allow adult pictures of the donor for legal reasons. So, at the end of the day, the attraction part of my search was also a gamble.)

I was searching for my version of good genes, who also looks good in jeans -- at least on paper.

I finished my search on the scientific side of things. The donor bank I chose provided a full medical history and genetic testing results. Honestly, why wouldn't you opt for a donor with no heart disease, cancer, mental illness or any other serious genetic conditions in his family history?

This is the one distinct advantage of going the donor route as opposed to the good old-fashioned route when conceiving. While I haven't polled my married or attached friends, I am 99.9% certain that not a single one queried their partner about the specifics of their family's medical history prior to sleeping with them or accepting a marriage proposal.

I was searching for my version of good genes, who also looks good in jeans -- at least on paper.

The longest days of my life

In early September, my blood work came back with hormone levels signaling pregnancy. I was in shock, but I had eight long weeks to go until seeing if there was a heartbeat or two. I started to take a pregnancy test every evening. It was the longest 56 days of my life.

D-Day finally arrived. And, there on the sonogram screen right in front of me, was the most beautiful thing: my child's heartbeat, strong and steady.

I had a million immediate questions for the sonographer and started right in. She stopped me, because there was heartbeat number two. Wait, what? I was laughing and crying at the same time. This must be what joy feels like, I thought.

The cliché that I despise most is: It will happen when you least expect it. Nonsense. I had gone almost 40 years expecting nothing in terms of dating, love and, God forbid, a husband -- and I received exactly that in return.

But suddenly the least expected had happened. I was pregnant with twins.

My journal entry from the evening read as follows:

Week 8, Day 1: October 6th D Day

Dear God: Thank you.

Baby A: your heartbeat was 159 today.

Baby B: your heartbeat was 168.

I love you A & B. Please keep growing. You're looking great.

Thank you, God. I pray for their development -- from their fingers to their toes. From brain to nose. I am so grateful for these precious beings. Prepare me to be the strong parent -- fiscally and spiritually -- that they will need me to be.

Love you.

The Friday of truth

On a Friday morning roughly 30 weeks after implantation, something seemed wrong. I had such severe leg cramps that I was crawling around the apartment on my hands and knees. I called an Uber at 8:30 am. Never having taken any birthing classes, I had no idea what the onset of labor looked like.

By the time I got to the hospital the pain was so intense that I could barely make it to the door. The Uber driver offered to help me up. I was immediately checked in and within minutes was told that I was 7 cm dilated and would be headed into an emergency C-section.

My heart stopped. I was petrified that those little heartbeats were going to stop and that my sons -- my sons -- were not going to make it. I was alone in the pre-delivery room just long enough to run through every awful scenario in my head.

And then it was time. Seventy minutes after arrival, I was wheeled into a room with a team of 16 doctors and nurses waiting for me. The sight of this army, the two waiting incubators and all the other metal contraptions made me well up. I had no idea what was going to happen next, but I had never expected it to happen quite like this -- not this early, not with these many medical professionals and not entirely on my own.

Eli and Abel have proven to be the embodiment of that saying you always hear -- the hardest, yet best thing I've ever done.

Doctors and nurses were working quickly all around me. Epidural, check. Babies' heart rates, check. Slicing me open, check. Ripping two crimson-colored sons out of me at 10:40 am and 10:43 am, check and check.

I saw Eli and Abel for a nanosecond before the nurses cut the cords and rushed them to their incubator stations to begin inserting the breathing tubes. They were 10 weeks premature and neither could suck, swallow or breathe on their own.

The two teams whisked my babies to the Level 4 NICU (neonatal intensive care unit) without me getting to touch their skin or ask if their vital signs were stable. I did hear them cry, which was a relief. I just wish my sisters had been there to take a picture and help recount what happened. I can't ever get that moment back.

Little did I know when I moved to Denver that I would be delivering twins two years later at Denver's premier NICU hospital -- The Rocky Mountain Hospital for Children at Presbyterian St. Luke's

I was not able to see my sons until nine very long hours after delivery. I walked into a room with two incubators housing my baby boys, who looked more like starved squirrels than the roly-poly infants that I had envisioned. All wired up, with IVs jutting out of the top of their skulls, they were absolutely perfect. Complete miracles from inception to emergency birth.

And, of course, they chose Friday the 13th of March to scare the living hell out of me and fight their way onto this Earth.

The next 60 days

Two weeks after I was released from the hospital, I found myself sleeping in my Denver home of almost two years, as my boys lived and slept inside NICU -- for 60 days straight.

And though I could easily have felt alone -- so removed from my two miracles -- I didn't.

Friends and family from across the country constantly checked in on me, calling, texting, writing me words of encouragement.

And even once Eli and Abel were out of NICU, loving and supporting friends -- and sometimes even strangers --continued to shower us with kindness and affection.

Initially, the NICU team was our rock. These complete strangers became the most significant and consequential people in the lives of my sons during their first two months. I will never be able to appropriately express my gratitude to the nurses and doctors who safeguarded their lives. Several are friends to this day.

Then my personal trainer and his wife, the first people to visit me in the hospital, became the most trusted and consistent presence in our lives. From celebrating our birthdays, to helping with our apartment move, to Fourth of July and Super Bowl celebrations, to just being those adult ears that I need -- Adam and Teri have been there for all of it.

You wake up every morning with a mandate and desire to be a better parent to your children than you were the day before.

The mother of twin boys, who lived steps away from me, became my sanity check. We were pregnant at the same time and delivered within weeks of each other. We met by fluke, thanks to a double stroller sighting in the alley.

And the parents of my first employee proved invaluable, babysitting the boys on weekends so I could nap.

I can't forget the British transplant, who regularly delivered homemade quiche on weeknights just because.

More recently, though, the manager at the Palm (steakhouse) took care of my family. It was Thanksgiving night, and I took the twins for our first holiday fête as a family of three. In one of the most random acts of kindness, the manager worked her way to our table, poured me a glass of wine, helped feed the boys, shared a bit of her life story with me and then bought our meal. She did not know me.

Most importantly, since the birth of Eli and Abel, my parents have fallen so completely in love with their grandsons that it's hard to fully put into words the intensity of their connection. What was at first an idea hard for my traditional parents to grasp, is now two, tiny human beings, who have my parents tightly wrapped around their little fingers. Though thousands of miles away, my parents -- and my sisters -- express their love and support constantly and in innumerable ways.

There are incredible people in this world. My sons' existences have made that real to me.

The lessons learned

Eli and Abel have proven to be the embodiment of that saying you always hear -- the hardest, yet best thing I've ever done.

My sons are my family and my future. They represent everything good, hopeful and hilarious about life. They smile and cheer when I walk into their room. They blow kisses and sneak hugs. They belly laugh when we dance. They cuddle up at night and put their heads in the crook of my neck.

They also scream, bite and bang their heads on the floor when they're upset. They chuck their food when they don't like it. They act like the world is coming to an end at bath time. And they are a constant financial stress. Being a single parent is hard as hell.

But from my two little men, I quickly internalized that love is a verb. Love is an action and something you work at every single day. You wake up every morning with a mandate and desire to be a better parent to your children than you were the day before.

They are my miracles, which I almost didn't allow to happen because of heartbreak, self-doubt and maybe even self-loathing.

Speaking of love, friends like to tell me that there is a man out there -- some wonderful man who will sweep me off my feet and be an excellent father. To that I say, please stop. Do I want to date? Of course. But I can honestly write that I have no expectations for love, and I certainly do not believe that there is a father out there for my sons. I am not waiting and hoping, because I have lost that hope.

Why have I lost that hope? Truth be told, I have been vulnerable with a few men pre- and post-pregnancy. But rejection upon rejection by man after man will do it to you. Even when you are that aloof gal, who doesn't ask questions or have expectations of something real or long-term, it still ends. I guess you just lose your luster after awhile. It's my reality, and it never changes.

And while we are on the topic of relationships, I would note that I will forever be perplexed by the rate of unsolicited and unexpected congratulatory communications from ex-boyfriends after years of no contact. These were the men who rejected me. These were the men who left after months or years of pretending and/or cheating.

After the birth of my sons, these same men suddenly thought they had a green card to strike up conversation and ask for pictures of the twins. One suggested grabbing dinner in DC. One kindly offered to come to Colorado to help run errands, cook dinner or do whatever I needed.

The attention was hard to digest. I once cried over these men. Perhaps this was a way of absolving their guilt for being dishonest or wasting my time? Perhaps they were sincerely happy for me, which would suggest that they did respect me after all? Perhaps they were feeling slighted or envious that I went it alone, without them? I'll never know.

And, most importantly, I finally no longer care.

Though I may never have a significant other, I do have my sons, who've taken me from unloved to loved and from unlovable to lovable. They've done this all on their own. They are my miracles, which I almost didn't allow to happen because of heartbreak, self-doubt and maybe even self-loathing.

Prior to Eli and Abel, I wasted at least half of my adult life obsessing about things I had lost -- men who broke my heart, clients who weren't a good fit, friendships that had faded.

My sons taught me to focus on the miracles that are right in front of my eyes every single day, beginning with my 3.7%.

Correction: This piece initially stated Lenti is in her fourth decade and has been amended to reflect that she is in her fifth decade. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
New York (CNN) On Tuesday, CNN Opinion published "Single, childless and nearing 40, I saw one real option," a personal essay by Sarah Lenti, a political strategist who decided to have children through in vitro fertilization (IVF). She writes: "I am a single mother by choice. Yet I was raised in a Christian, conservative home, where I grew up believing in the traditional family unit. And I was taught that there was an order to achieving it. First, fall in love. Second, marry a man. Third, start a family. Now in my fifth decade, only one has proven true for me -- and it isn't the first."

Lenti's piece was the first of a CNN Opinion series, "What it's like to be me," which explores personal struggles Americans face in a time of social change.

We asked you, CNN's audience, to share your stories of IVF and adoption through text message and WhatsApp -- and you responded with personal experiences that were as various as they were emotionally compelling.

You shared with us stories of your joys and your struggles. You shared family photos -- and some of you even sent us videos about your families' journeys. Here they are.

Yazmil: Bronx, New York

Yazmil with her daughter at 9 months

"The article I just read in CNN on a single mom by choice hit home. My daughter just turned 1 and I too began this journey a little less than two years ago. I will be 38 in May and I always wanted a family. I dated someone long-term and when that relationship ended, by the time I finished licking my wounds, I was 36 with no prospects. I went on every online dating site and never met anyone worth my time. I decided to give insemination a try. I conceived relatively quickly. It was the best decision for me. I know another friend who went this route and after sharing my story many more friends are interested in becoming single moms by choice. It's not that I don't want a partner, I just didn't want my opportunity to become a mother to pass me by in the meantime.

"(The article) made me happy to know that more women are not afraid to say how they conceived their babies outside of "traditional relationships." That we are taking control of our lives, our fertility and bringing babies into this world that are wanted and loved before they are even conceived."

Tony and Brian: New Jersey

Tony and Brian with their daughter, Chelsea.

"Blessed and fortunate to have my own modern family thanks to surrogacy.

"Our dream of having a baby started in 2014, the year we got married. We found a surrogacy agency in an IVF practice in Connecticut. We were matched with our first surrogate in 2015 and she got pregnant right away, but sadly she had a miscarriage at eight-and-a-half weeks. We were devastated and upset, naturally, but we knew we didn't want to give up because we really wanted to have a baby. So we waited and we tried again and were matched with another surrogate in 2016 and she also got pregnant right away, but this time she carried the baby to 38-and-a-half weeks and we had Chelsea.

"We feel really lucky and fortunate to have Chelsea because we know how difficult it can be to have a baby in untraditional ways. Even if you have all the means and resources necessary that doesn't always guarantee a baby. "

"My name is Jo Zmood. I am a single mum of two now. Originally from Australia -- hence "mum" not "mom." I've lived in New York for 10 years, and while there are many books out there that talk about different types of families I couldn't quite find the right book to share with my son to provide him some explanation of my choice to bring him into this world alone. So I wrote my own story for him. The article inspired me to share it.

"He never asked any questions and understands some of his friends have dads and some don't. I wanted to answer his question of why he doesn't, regardless of whether the question is posed. And to let him know the subject was not taboo."

"During the three years I struggled to get pregnant with my second child as a solo parent, people close to me asked if I should consider the failed pregnancies a sign to give up. I was not giving up. The years of navigating fibroid tumors, surgeries and infertility finally came to an end with the birth of my second son, Oliver. He was born with my eggs and the help of my cousin as my surrogate. My journey as a solo parent also ended when I met my husband right before learning my surrogate was pregnant with Oliver. We were both solo parents in our 40s and had never been married before. Our journey to building a family may not have taken a typical path, but what we have today is my dream come true."

"When I was younger I was told that I didn't have enough estrogen to be able to carry a pregnancy. My ex-husband couldn't have children either so we adopted two babies within three years. The marriage ended a few years later and I remarried the following year. My new husband and I started our married life with two 4-year-olds and a 2-year-old.

"Then the surprises came. I had babies at age 35, 39, and 46 -- -- all conceived the old-fashioned way!"

Elisabeth Szentkereszty de Zagon: Brussels, Belgium

Elisabeth and her daughter Lynne enjoy a duck tour on a visit to Boston.

"I am a US-Belgian dual citizen, single mom, living in Brussels After many failed attempts (albeit fun) at a real relationship, I decided to have a child on my own. Having a supportive family, especially my sister living in Belgium, was one of the reasons I did not hesitate to go solo.

"When the adoption agency called me saying that they had received the picture of my daughter, I ran to go see her photo.

"After an exhausting trip, arrived late into the night in Changsha, capital of the Hunan province, we went to the office of child affairs, or something of the sort, and each waited until we were called and they brought the babies out one by one. I looked at her as they were putting her in my arms, the most amazing and unreal feeling possible. She cried right away and I put a pacifier in her mouth and it calmed her right away.

"What I remember most, is putting her on a chair in the hotel room and just staring at this little bundle of baby and saying, I cannot believe she is mine! The wait had not been too long (seven months for China to pair me up with Lynne and from the start of the process of first meeting with the agency to the file being sent was about 12 months, so all in all, about one-and-a-half years -- so not too long)."

"Although she's a typical teenager, we have a lot of good times," Elisabeth says of her daughter Lynne.

"She got attached to me immediately and when we were in the dining hall, I could not even leave her in her buggy to get food, she had to come with me and see me. The nannies had told me that she was always crawling behind one or the other person at the orphanage so she had to be in someone's company at all times.

"She still does not like being alone! She loves being close to me and needs company to be happy, even if now, as a teen, she can spend hours in her room doing who knows what! I call her my little pot of glue.

"Adopting is not easy. I mean being a single mom, making all the decisions, is hard. And having a smart child, ahead of her years for some things, is challenging to say the least. Also, an abandoned child's brain develops differently and this is why sometimes, they rebel against us and make life very hard. They try, albeit unconsciously, to do all they can to push us away. They are repeating the abandonment they felt as a child. But you have to hold fast, hold on and show you are always there. But it's tough when they bite and scratch and break things, kick you etc ... But with the help of family, psychologists and relational therapy, you get it done. And now, although she's a typical teenager, we have a lot of good times.

"What she wants the most is spending time with me, so when we can, we travel. We've been to Burkina Faso, Mexico, China (went back to do some volunteer teaching for 3 months in 2009 near Qingdao), all over Europe, California, New York, Atlanta, South Carolina, Boston, Cuba ... She has a map on her wall with pins of all the places she's been. We'd like to go to Japan next!

"All in all, being a mom is the toughest job. It is also the most rewarding. I do not know how they decide which parent gets which child in China, but I would not have wanted any other. It had to be her, no one else. I love her with all my heart. And I do get the love back. Those few moments when she shows her love with no boundaries are worth all the pain I go through to be her mom. I'd do it all the same if I had to. Would not change a thing!"

Kristen Kane and her son, Elijah.

"I am a single parent by choice. I decided at 25 that I wanted to adopt. It was something that was important to me, so I did. Not all of my family and friends were on board, but I knew it's what I was meant to do. The process was faster and smoother than I could have ever imagined. My son was in my arms just four months after my home study was completed. We maintain a relationship with his birth family, which I am very thankful for. Although it hasn't been easy, it has been worth it. He brings so much joy to myself and my family. He's such a wonderful, loving little boy. Even those that weren't on board with my choice to pursue adoption at such a young age are just simply amazed at how incredibly perfect he is for our family. We love him with every ounce of our being.

"The one aspect of the adoption that I feel I wasn't prepared for was the current environment that I am raising a black son in. I have always tried to be a strong advocate for the AA community and to stay educated, but never really understood what it meant to be black in America until I saw the world through my son's eyes. Although I still don't fully understand, as I myself am shielded with my own privilege, my eyes have been opened. Sometimes painfully so. I worry about him every day. But, he is my world and I would do it again in a heart beat." <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.

(CNN) How bad will it get? That was the question this week, but it applied to several things: the spread of COVID-19 coronavirus around the world, the resulting stock market plunge and the concern about whether America's political leaders are up to the challenge.

An outbreak of the disease is inevitable in the US, Dr. Nancy Messonnier, of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, told reporters Tuesday: "It's not so much a question of if this will happen anymore, but ... a question of exactly when this will happen and how many people in this country will have severe illness."

Dr., Baltimore's former health commissioner, wrote that the disease "will test our government's response and resiliency . How we weather the outbreak also hinges on our trust that the government has our best intentions at heart." She added that, "we don't yet know if the trajectory of COVID-19 will be mild, moderate, or severe" but it makes sense to prepare for the worst case.

Wall Street apparently agreed, with the Dow plunging 3,583 points, making it by percentage terms the worst week since October, 2008. In the Perspectives section of CNN Business,recalled covering that financial crisis. " That was a terrifying time — but this seems a lot scarier ," he wrote. "Yes, the Fed can do lots of things to help soothe frayed nerves when stocks are in free fall, but there is little that the Fed — or President Trump and Congress, for that matter — can do to solve this biological crisis for the markets and the economy."

"Even if all the cases were limited to China, the rest of the globe would feel it. That's because China has become a global economic powerhouse." And by now the virus has gone well beyond the borders of China.

"The best advice for Americans now is to wash your hands often and listen to the experts -- not to the President. He's not telling the truth. He's gaslighting, muddling and contradicting the urgent public health advice from experts," Ghitis wrote. She noted, "It's not out of the question that coronavirus could become Trump's 'black swan,' the low-probability, high-impact event that changes everything, even his prospects for reelection."

David Ignatius wrote that, "one of President Trump's failings is that In the Washington Post,wrote that, "one of President Trump's failings is that he thinks he knows better than his experts — more about the military than his generals, more about the economy than his Fed chairman, more about intelligence than his spymasters and now, we fear, more about public health than his doctors...Trump made a bad mistake when he seemed to endorse a questioner's suggestion that the CDC was 'exaggerating' the threat." Taking it further, at a South Carolina rally Friday, Trump said, "the Democrats are politicizing the coronavirus" in what he called "their new hoax."

Joe Lockhart -- Reagan after the Challenger explosion, Bill Clinton after the Oklahoma City bombing, George W. Bush grabbing the bullhorn after the 9/11 attacks. So far, Trump is failing that leadership test, Lockhart said. "He has Presidents are called upon to reassure the nation in the wake of traumatic events, wrote-- Reagan after the Challenger explosion, Bill Clinton after the Oklahoma City bombing, George W.

"He has consistently underplayed the potential for a serious public health crisis here at home."

He has eliminated the position of Global Health Czar and has repeatedly proposed cuts important to global health funding -- thankfully that have failed to pass in Congress."

Mike Pence is in charge

Trump put Vice President Mike Pence in charge of the effort to combat the virus. " It's hard to imagine a worse choice for a job that requires respect for public health ," wrote Pence biographer Michael D'Antonio. "In addition to his climate-change skepticism...he is known for penning, when he was running for Congress, what could be generously termed a nutty article that said, 'despite the hysteria from the political class and the media, smoking doesn't kill.'"

Colleen Kraft, the associate medical director of Emory's Serious Communicable Diseases Unit: "Use soap and water for the amount of time it takes to sing the 'Happy Birthday' song, or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. In a study we conducted on hand hygiene, the As we wait to see the extent of the virus outbreak, here's some useful advice from Dr., the associate medical director of Emory's Serious Communicable Diseases Unit: "Use soap and water for the amount of time it takes to sing the 'Happy Birthday' song, or an alcohol-based hand sanitizer. In a study we conducted on hand hygiene, the most common areas missed by hand washers were thumbs, wrists, and in between fingers."

The Super Tuesday test

The Democratic primary is at a critical moment. Joe Biden scored a decisive victory Saturday in South Carolina, but will he have the momentum to unseat Bernie Sanders as the Democrats' frontrunner?

Jeff Yang, "and other centrist candidates "Moderate voters may well snap back into the Biden camp," wrote, "and other centrist candidates may feel the pressure to make an increasingly hard decision : Whether to stay in the race and continue to fragment the vote against Sanders — or bow out and lend support to Biden."

On Super Tuesday, March 3, roughly a third of the delegates will be chosen and the race could be decided within weeks -- or remain hotly contested until the Democrats meet for their convention in Milwaukee in July.

Elliot Williams summed up the moderates' feeling: Sanders "struggles to say what his ambitious plans will cost. If elected, he would become the oldest president in US history and he has flip-flopped on whether he would release his full medical records (this is after having already suffered a heart attack). summed up the moderates' feeling: Sanders "struggles to say what his ambitious plans will cost. If elected, he would become the oldest president in US history and he has flip-flopped on whether he would release his full medical records (this is after having already suffered a heart attack). He all but ensures that his Republican opponent will make the election a referendum on socialism ...Attack ads from President Donald Trump and his allies assailing Sanders' views on Fidel Castro and Soviet Russia practically write themselves. And don't get me started about the conduct of some of his supporters and even some of his staffers online."

"Take a deep breath" anyway, Williams added. "Bernie Sanders has as good a shot as any of the other candidates at beating Trump -- maybe even a better one."

Rebecca Bodenheimer agreed that it was "ill-advised" but argued that it wasn't wrong: " When Sanders praised some aspects of dictator Fidel Castro's regime in Cuba, critics called it an unforced error and said it would hurt him badly with Cuban-American emigres in Florida.agreed that it was "ill-advised" but argued that it wasn't wrong: " Both the things he said were true : the Castro regime (and the successive iterations of it under Raúl Castro and now Miguel Díaz-Canel) was and is authoritarian...And, early on in the 1960s, Castro initiated a grassroots program that resulted in a massive increase in literacy in Cuba, as well as building a strong universal healthcare and educational system."

Dean Obeidallah noted: "Sanders was scheduled to hold a rally at a 5,000-seat venue in Denver, but because of a tsunami of demand, the campaign moved it to a larger venue where he drew more than 11,000. Two weeks ago, the night before the New Hampshire primary, Sanders packed more than 7,500 into an arena, with USA Today noting that this 'event easily marked Sanders is stirring excitement around the country,noted: "Sanders was scheduled to hold a rally at a 5,000-seat venue in Denver, but because of a tsunami of demand, the campaign moved it to a larger venue where he drew more than 11,000.

A moderate Republican, former Rep. Charlie Dent contemplated the prospect of a Sanders-Trump race with real dread. "Both represent two sides of the same coin," Dent wrote. "They both appeal to anger. They scream that the system is rigged, you're a victim, and that they can give you your country back if only you follow them."

Millions of voters are in the middle, between the left and the right, he said. They "want a candidate who believes in capitalism, reasonably regulated market-based solutions to problems, social tolerance and acceptance, and constructive international engagement...Most of all they'll want someone who conducts himself or herself in a thoughtful, deliberate and measured way. They want stability, not chaos and recklessness ."

Errol Louis. Elizabeth Warren picked up where she left off at the Nevada debate, with blistering attacks on billionaire Mike Bloomberg. But the former New York mayor seemed much more prepared this time. "Mayor Michael Bloomberg fought his way back into contention in the Democratic primary for president by obeying a simple rule: never let an attack go unanswered ," wrote

The sheer force of Bloomberg's money cascade is keeping him a major factor in the election. He could wind up spending billions on advertising in pursuit of the presidency, wrote tax expert Edward McCaffery, who argued that whatever its political impact, it is a financially savvy move.

"As an aging billionaire many times over, Mayor Bloomberg sees the clock ticking." Bloomberg's fortune has been estimated at more than $60 billion. Whatever he doesn't spend or give away will be subject to the 40% federal estate tax.

So if he spends $5 billion to get to the White House, the US Treasury will ultimately lose out on $2 billion in taxes, McCaffery pointed out.

"This is in no way a condemnation of Mayor Bloomberg, who has presumably earned his money legally, and can spend it however he wants, again perfectly legally... It is, rather, a condemnation of a tax system that both allows some billionaires to amass wealth and to spend it, tax free and with no questions asked ."

After the Harvey Weinstein verdict

The onetime Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein was convicted of sexual assault and rape charges that could send him to prison for a minimum of five years. It was a win for the #MeToo movement, wrote Caroline Polisi.

The "verdict will encourage more victims of sexual assault to come forward and report their abuse, with the knowledge that although the road to justice will not be easy, it will at least be a possibility. And that is so much more than they ever had before."

Two things have to happen now, wrote Kara Alaimo. There needs to be more visibility about non-disclosure agreements that have been used to bury allegations against powerful abusers, she said.

"Second, lawmakers need to help victims learn their rights and avenues for redress -- especially those who are most disenfranchised. If it's hard for Hollywood actresses like Ashley Judd -- whose sexual harassment case against Weinstein was thrown out of court by a judge and characterized as not justified by Weinstein's attorney -- to pursue justice, consider how difficult it would be for people with far fewer resources."

A raid on the fifth grade

Wazhma Frogh is nearly 40 but she can't forget the raid on her Kabul public school when she was in fifth grade.

I still remember the exact words of those bearded men, Kalashnikovs on their shoulders, batons in their hand -- as they yelled, 'Get out of here. Girls don't belong in schools!' I can even remember the cries of several of our teachers, who were wearing skirts and were beaten in their legs, as the Mujahedeen shouted that their skirt wearing days were over."

Wazhma Frogh

It was the start of a civil war that closed down the schools. Frogh, now the leader of the Women and Peace Studies organization in Kabul, wrote that she "never saw my classmates or my teachers ever again."

She argued that, as the US embarks on a troop withdrawal agreement with the Taliban, it's vital that the experience of the early 1990s -- "when civil war and extremist forces came to dominate our politics and our lives" -- not be repeated.

Peter Bergen wrote that leaving a small number of US troops in Afghanistan for counterterrorism purposes makes eminent sense. "For the moment Trump seems to understand that the only thing worse than staying in Afghanistan is leaving it completely. But he is also consistently inconsistent when it comes to foreign policy, and wrote that leaving a small number of US troops in Afghanistan for counterterrorism purposes makes eminent sense. "For the moment Trump seems to understand that the only thing worse than staying in Afghanistan is leaving it completely. But he is also consistently inconsistent when it comes to foreign policy, and he could just as easily pull the plug entirely ." The agreement calls for a full withdrawal over a 14-month period but officials say that is dependent on what the Taliban does.

Katharine Johnson, an American hero

Katharine Johnson was so central to NASA's exploration of space that, as Reshma Saujani wrote, "Astronaut John Glenn famously asked Katherine to personally recheck the calculations made by electronic computers before his Friendship 7 mission to space. 'If she says they're good,' he said, 'then I'm ready to go.'" On that mission in 1962, Glenn became the first American to orbit the earth.

Johnson, who died this week at 101, lived to see her story told in the Oscar-nominated film "Hidden Figures." She was portrayed by Taraji P. Henson. "In a world that all too often tells girls -- especially black girls -- that they don't belong in STEM, Katherine Johnson was exactly the icon our girls needed," wrote Saujani, the founder and CEO of Girls Who Code, a national nonprofit. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

Only in an election year would the best show in Vegas be a Democratic presidential debate. But this was no Cirque du Soleil -- more like Future Stars of Wrestling. Elizabeth Warren -- and pretty much everyone else -- aggressively went after an apparently flummoxed Michael Bloomberg, making his much-anticipated debut Wednesday -- just a few days before the Nevada caucuses. The candidates also came hard at each other this time, on a night of fireworks and faceplants; several CNN commentators described it as a "free-for-all" -- and they were not wrong.

But with the eyes of much of the nation on him, and his self-funded star on the rise, it was billionaire Bloomberg, who was the target of choice for his fellow candidates. The nearly unanimous verdict on his performance from a diverse panel of CNN Opinion commentators ? "It was a horrible night."

Or, in the words of David Axelrod, a "disastrous debut."

Some, like SE Cupp, were at least relieved that at last the gloves were off. "Well it's about time," Cupp wrote. "It took, evidently, Michael Bloomberg on the debate stage for Democrats to realize that this primary can't be a group effort and a love fest forever." Scott Jennings didn't mince words: "Finally, this debate has revealed what I thought was probably true -- these Democrats running for president really seemed to hate each other."

Errol Louis assessed a winning strategy in Warren's pugnacity and preparation; likewise, Patti Solis Doyle saw a "thrilling tactical moment" when Warren "gutted Bloomberg on his non-disclosure agreements in cases of alleged sexual harassment." Tara Setmayer thought much of the anti-Bloomberg energy was misplaced -- suggesting Sanders, as an emerging frontrunner, deserved the target on his back, if the Democrats really want a candidate who can win against President Donald Trump.

Frida Ghitis wondered. Debate coach Todd Graham delivered a Amy Klobuchar and Pete Buttigieg sniped at one another over experience and drew mixed reviews. "What more could President Donald Trump ask for" than a divided opposition,wondered. Debate coachdelivered a rather stern report card : no one got an A, but Sanders drew the highest grade (B+) He "handled himself well when placed center stage," Graham wrote, and shone when talking about policy in moral terms.

An intelligence community in turmoil

The intelligence world was in chaos this week after Trump's decision to appoint US Ambassador to Germany Richard Grenell as acting director of national intelligence. A staunch loyalist with no intelligence background and a reputation for alienating people, wrote David Andelman -- Grenell replaces outgoing acting director Joseph Maguire.

Andelman called Grenell a "catastrophe-in-waiting" unqualified to hold a post so central to America's national security, and implored Trump to reconsider. "Most alarming" were reports that Trump's dissatisfaction with Maguire -- who had briefed a bipartisan committee in Congress that Russia was back at its election interference efforts -- contributed to his departure and Grenell's appointment, Andelman wrote.

William McRaven on Maguire's behalf in the Washington Post, praising his long experience and record of service and concluding that Maguire "was dismissed for doing his job." He warned: "As Americans, we should be frightened -- deeply afraid for the future of the nation. When good men and women can't speak the truth, when facts are inconvenient, when integrity and character no longer matter, when presidential ego and self-preservation are more important than national security -- then there is nothing left to stop the triumph of evil." Admiral spoke out strongly on Maguire's behalf in the Washington Post, praising his long experience and record of service and concluding that Maguire "was dismissed for doing his job." He warned: "As Americans, we should be frightened -- deeply afraid for the future of the nation. When good men and women can't speak the truth, when facts are inconvenient, when integrity and character no longer matter, when presidential ego and self-preservation are more important than national security -- then there is nothing left to stop the triumph of evil."

Do Democrats really need a billionaire of their own?

Brower noted that in 2020, if Bloomberg faces Trump, voters would have the right to ask: "Can't (we) do better than two billionaires who are accused of demeaning women?" On Friday, Bloomberg said women covered by three NDAs who had made complaints against him can be released from those agreements if they contact his company.

David Love urged Democrats urged Democrats to think twice before casting their lot during the primary with an oligarch of their own; for Love, a potential choice between the moderate Bloomberg and the progressive Sanders posed a moral dilemma for democracy. In his view, "It's not a stretch to say that when it comes to the role of wealth in determining the elections, the contrast between Bloomberg and Bernie Sanders is one with moral stakes."

William Barber and Liz Theoharis, co-chairs of the Poor People's Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival, The Revs.and, co-chairs of the Poor People's Campaign: A National Call for Moral Revival, also offered moral arguments this week , but not on behalf of a particular candidate.

Stone cold sentenced

James Schultz, formerly of the Trump White House counsel's office, insisted that Barr Michael Zeldin Frida Ghitis, "Stone's sentencing turned into a microcosm of the battle to save the rule of law in this country ... On Thursday, in Judge Jackson's courtroom, the rule of law fought back." On Thursday, all eyes were on Judge Amy Berman Jackson's courtroom, where longtime Trump confidant Roger Stone faced sentencing after being convicted of crimes including lying, obstruction and witness tampering. Prosecutors had recommended seven to nine years. Then Trump tweeted and Attorney General William Barr intervened, undercutting his own prosecutors to suggest a lighter sentence., formerly of the Trump White House counsel's office, insisted that Barr had done the right thing inserting himself into the process. "The reality is the sentencing recommendation of seven to nine years for Stone was a ridiculous overreach," he wrote. noted that : "Trump's encroachment into DOJ territory, especially in such a public way, was unprecedented." "Indeed," argued , "Stone's sentencing turned into a microcosm of the battle to save the rule of law in this country ... On Thursday, in Judge Jackson's courtroom, the rule of law fought back."

Michael D'Antonio observed, Jackson "demonstrated genuine fairness ... Now it will be up to the President to either honor the decision or commute the sentence of his friend and show that it is he -- and not the system -- that is corrupt." In sentencing Stone to over three years in federal prison,observed, Jackson "demonstrated genuine fairness ... Now it will be up to the President to either honor the decision or commute the sentence of his friend and show that it is he -- and not the system -- that is corrupt."

Pardons, pardons everywhere

Trump's rush of surprise pardons and commutations this week read like a casting call for Lifestyles of the Rich, Famous and Felonious: Among others, former San Francisco 49ers owner Eddie DeBartolo Jr. (failing to report a felony in a bribery case), once-junk bond king Michael Milken (racketeering and securities fraud), Rudy Giuliani's ex-New York City police commissioner Bernard Kerik (tax fraud and lying to the federal government). And then there was an actual former "Celebrity Apprentice," disgraced ex-Illinois Gov. Rod Blagojevich (public corruption).

Paul Callan After Tuesday's spate of high-profile pardons, marveled , "there's reason to wonder if the role (of acting pardon attorney of the US) should be offered to Geraldo Rivera -- or Kim Kardashian West. When President Barack Obama pardoned 78 people in December 2016, the White House announcement simply listed those given pardons and commuted sentences, along with details of their offenses. But when Trump used his powers to give clemency to 11 people, the press secretary's statement was larded with the often-famous names of those vouching for the pardoned," implying that Trump's mercy favors those with special connections.

LZ Granderson. "What we have been witnessing recently is not in the spirit of the Constitution's Article II, Section 2, but in the spirit of authoritarianism. For it is one thing for a president to commute a sentence if she or he feels the individual has paid their debt to society, but it's totally another if the president intervenes with the belief there wasn't a debt to begin with." "In also showing mercy late last year to two officers accused of war crimes, one convicted of murder, President Trump again dismissed the justice system" -- both civilian and military, asserted . "What we have been witnessing recently is not in the spirit of the Constitution's Article II, Section 2, but in the spirit of authoritarianism. For it is one thing for a president to commute a sentence if she or he feels the individual has paid their debt to society, but it's totally another if the president intervenes with the belief there wasn't a debt to begin with."

What does it mean to be redeemed?

James A. Gagliano -- lifelong lover of the NFL's Atlanta Falcons, a team lit up (and then laid low) by legendary quarterback Michael Vick -- -- lifelong lover of the NFL's Atlanta Falcons, a team lit up (and then laid low) by legendary quarterback Michael Vick -- made the case directly to Trump that Vick, who was sentenced to 23 months on dog-fighting charges in 2007, should be pardoned. Gagliano recalls Vick's post-prison rehabilitation efforts on and off the field and his emotional welcome back to the Georgia Dome to be recognized as one of the best Falcons players of all time.

"Vick's tale is one of against-long-odds achievement, meteoric ascension to the pinnacle of his profession and losing it all," reflected Gagliano. "It is also a story of forgiveness, second acts and deserved redemption ... Michael Vick made good on his second chance. He's back working in football as a television analyst. He's a family man. He has acknowledged his failures and atoned for them. He has blamed no one else but himself ... here's hoping you'll give this pardon request some serious consideration, Mr. President."

The Times and the terrorist

Sirajuddin Haqqani, identifying him only as the "deputy leader of the Taliban," in which he argued: "I am convinced that the killing and the maiming must stop." On Thursday, the New York Times published an op-ed byidentifying him only as the "deputy leader of the Taliban," in which he argued: "I am convinced that the killing and the maiming must stop."

Peter Bergen, who has covered Afghanistan for CNN for over 20 years, , who has covered Afghanistan for CNN for over 20 years, was shocked by what the Times didn't say about Haqqani -- that the FBI considers him a "specially designated global terrorist" and that both the FBI and State Department are offering a reward for information leading to his capture.

Haqqani leads a network whose members have kidnapped multiple Americans, including a Times reporter, noted Bergen, who opined: "President Trump sees himself as elected to get out of America's 'endless wars.' But there is a big difference between fighting an endless war and instituting a persistent presence in Afghanistan to safeguard both American interests and those of the Afghan people ... Haqqani's tepid assurances in the Times that the Taliban, going forward, will be just a normal bunch of Afghan politicians don't mesh well with the FBI's continued assessment that he is one of the world's most wanted terrorists."

The Times said in a statement from a spokesperson: "We know firsthand how dangerous and destructive the Taliban is. The Times is one of the only American news organizations to have maintained a full time team of reporters in Afghanistan since the start of the war nearly 20 years ago. We've also had multiple journalists kidnapped by the organization. But, our mission at Times Opinion is to tackle big ideas from a range of newsworthy viewpoints. We've actively solicited voices from all sides of the Afghanistan conflict, the government, the Taliban and from citizens. Sirajuddin Haqqani is the second in command of the Taliban at a time when its negotiators are hammering out an agreement with American officials in Doha that could result in American troops leaving Afghanistan. That makes his perspective relevant at this particular moment." US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the United States will sign a peace deal with the Taliban on February 29 provided there is a weeklong reduction in violence in Afghanistan, slated to begin Saturday.

(CNN) In 2016, Donald Trump did his best to tarnish his opponent Hillary Clinton with an email "scandal" that amounted to nothing. In his 2020 reelection campaign, Trump's team has worked to conjure a similar cloud of controversy over Joe Biden's son Hunter, all without producing evidence of wrongdoing.

But now that Biden is fighting to save his candidacy, the President may have to prepare for a complicated set of competitors -- including Michael Bloomberg, a deci-billionaire who is spending whatever it takes to win; Bernie Sanders, a "Democratic socialist" who won the New Hampshire primary and has the allegiance of many young voters; and Pete Buttigieg and Amy Klobuchar, two fresher faces with growing support.

This week, Democratic candidates will appear in CNN town halls and face off in a debate in Las Vegas days before Saturday's Nevada caucus.

The previously "unelectable" Mike Bloomberg is being given a serious look by Democrats, wrote Joe Lockhart. The former New York mayor is "charisma challenged," has taken controversial stances, and in many quarters is seen as a symbol of the unaccountable one percent, Lockhart noted.

Arick Wierson, but he should think twice before accepting. "Holding his own on next week's national stage would be a boon to the campaign, but the chances of him coming off as dry, lacking empathy, and somewhat mechanical loom large... Bloomberg may soon qualify for his first debate, wrote his former aide, but he should think twice before accepting. "Holding his own on next week's national stage would be a boon to the campaign, but the chances of him coming off as dry, lacking empathy, and somewhat mechanical loom large... Bloomberg is not exactly a warm and fuzzy guy . He has a good sense of humor, but it's dry and a bit racy, meaning it rarely comes out in a public forum. He can appear stiff -- possibly why President Trump has taken to Twitter to troll the former mayor, tweeting that he 'can't debate and has zero presence.' "

Jill Filipovic to write, " Bloomberg has been effusively apologizing for his "stop and frisk" program in New York City. Last week, a 2015 audio recording resurfaced, with the former mayor speaking about crime in minority neighborhoods, promptingto write, " These statements should be disqualifying for Bloomberg on their face: We definitely don't need another president who uses racist scare tactics and outlandishly false claims to justify his bad policy goals."

Tara Setmayer, but time is running out: "Months of the Republicans' constant drumbeat of blatant falsehoods and character assassination against Biden and his son Hunter throughout the impeachment trial, without an aggressive strategy from Biden to get ahead of it, has apparently worked. Biden's inability to seize control of the narrative and effectively mount an offense may have mortally wounded his candidacy. Biden, the Democrats' onetime frontrunner, still has a shot, argued, but time is running out: "Months of the Republicans' constant drumbeat of blatant falsehoods and character assassination against Biden and his son Hunter throughout the impeachment trial, without an aggressive strategy from Biden to get ahead of it, has apparently worked. Biden's inability to seize control of the narrative and effectively mount an offense may have mortally wounded his candidacy. If Biden loses South Carolina, it's over ."

Uncle Joe goes negative

Lockhart said it was "off brand" for Uncle Joe to attack a fellow Democrat that way. Even worse, he wrote, it was "a week too late. The campaign had to have seen the momentum Buttigieg was building in Iowa. Waiting until a rival wins, or co-wins, the first campaign test In the days before the New Hampshire primary, Biden rolled out a slashingly negative ad about former South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg.said it was "off brand" for Uncle Joe to attack a fellow Democrat that way. Even worse, he wrote, it was "a week too late. The campaign had to have seen the momentum Buttigieg was building in Iowa. Waiting until a rival wins, or co-wins, the first campaign test makes the negative attack seem desperate, rather than strategic ."

Errol Louis. Buttigieg now leads the field in total delegates and placed just behind Sanders in New Hampshire, while Biden came in fifth, behind Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren. "Any lingering sense of Biden's inevitability or electability died in the Granite State," wrote

David Gergen. " Sanders was widely proclaimed the frontrunner after Tuesday's primary, but without scoring a dominating victory. The Vermont senator deserves congratulations for being the "most popular socialist in American history," wrote. " But he may have crested in the 2016 campaign. After all, he won New Hampshire by over 20 points then against Hillary Clinton; this time, he won New Hampshire by less than 2 percentage points. And across most of the Democratic Party, strategists are worried about his chances against President Donald Trump. To them, he is the Jeremy Corbyn (leader of Britain's Labour Party) of the American left."

Alice Stewart "is the candidate to keep an eye on... His moderate views and new generation of leadership is Mayor Pete, wrote"is the candidate to keep an eye on... His moderate views and new generation of leadership is a more viable pathway to a new majority for the Democratic Party ."

Buttigieg was the target of a "homophobic rant" from Rush Limbaugh, the radio host recently awarded the Medal of Freedom by Donald Trump, noted LZ Granderson.

Limbaugh talked of "the discomfort some voters would experience watching Buttigieg kiss his husband on the debate stage, especially if he's standing next to, as he put it, 'Mr. Man, Donald Trump.' As offensive as Limbaugh's remarks about Buttigieg were (and as ironic as his holding up Trump as the epitome of manliness were, considering it was the gay dude who volunteered to fight for this country and the straight one who pleaded 'bone spurs'), the reality is homophobia is not theoretical...it is actively practiced."

Southern strategy

After Nevada, the Democratic primary heads south, beginning with South Carolina Feb. 29. "Come on down, y'all," wrote former New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu. "Now that almost 2% of delegates have been awarded from two very white states, attention will quickly shift to my neck of the woods," he noted.

"There are states with major delegate hauls. And states where black and brown voters will play a huge role...ultimately, southern Democrats are pragmatists. They want someone who can beat Trump and restore sanity to the White House.

Oh, and the food. "The southern food culture is strong, from Texas, Memphis and Carolina BBQ to the Deep South's soul food to the shrimp and grits of the Low Country. So be prepared to eat."

Why prosecutors quit Roger Stone case

The notorious political trickster and Trump acolyte Roger Stone faces sentencing Thursday on charges of lying to Congress, obstruction of justice and witness tampering.

It was not surprising last week when President Trump tweeted that the recommended prison sentence being sought by the Justice Department was "horrible and very unfair." But it was a stunning departure from Justice Department practice when the department's leadership overruled the four prosecutors who tried Stone and recommended a more lenient sentence.

Carrie Cordero, a former Justice official, wrote, "Four federal prosecutors didn't withdraw from the case against Roger Stone Tuesday because they had a substantive disagreement with their management.

Trump and Attorney General William Barr, Frida Ghitis wrote, "were following along a well-trod path across history: the systematic crushing of the independence of the judiciary. We have seen this movie before. It doesn't end well." She added, that it "has been the course charted by malign populists across the political spectrum, on the left and on the right. We saw it in Hugo Chavez's Venezuela and in Vladimir Putin's Russia -- and too many others."

As lawyers around the country objected to the Justice Department's actions, Barr observed that Trump's tweets were making his job impossible. But the White House seemed to have known Barr's complaint was coming.

"Claims that the Justice Department's decision had nothing to do with Trump's wishes takes Americans for fools, " Ghitis wrote.

Republican commentator Alice Stewart has a special vantage point on Roger Stone. As communications director for Ted Cruz' presidential campaign, she saw the damage wrought by false stories spread by Stone. "The personal character assassinations are just a small fraction of Stone's life's work dedicated to political destruction," Stewart wrote.

"It's fully appropriate for Stone's character history to be considered in the upcoming sentencing. Understanding full well that a presidential pardon is likely on the horizon, I encourage Judge (Amy) Jackson to lean on the high end of the guidelines and let the chips fall where they may ."

Payback tour

The Justice Department's about-face came after Trump started rooting out those who testified during his impeachment hearings. Elie Honig argued that Trump's dismissal of Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman amounted to criminal witness retaliation.

"Trump himself publicly admitted that his purpose was to retaliate , directly mentioning Vindman's testimony as a cause for the move; Vindman 'reported contents of my 'perfect' calls incorrectly,' said Trump. When asked if Vindman deserves disciplinary action, Trump said that the decision lies with the military. And Donald Trump Jr. outright gloated in a tweet, delighting in the vengeful nature of the removals of two decorated military veterans."

Peter Bergen wrote, "We have come to an extraordinary moment in the United States when some of the It was too much for former White House chief of staff Gen. John Kelly, who defended Vindman's decision to protest what he considered an "illegal order."wrote, "We have come to an extraordinary moment in the United States when some of the most senior retired military leaders in the country are publicly taking President Trump to task . Traditionally, such officers have not taken political positions, even in retirement."

The real George Washington

"You Never Forget Your First," is the clever title of a new biography of George Washington by Alexis Coe. In honor of President's Day, Jane Greenway Carr interviewed the author and noted, Coe "is the first woman to write a book about America's first president in nearly half a century."

Carr wrote, "If you're a lover or student of American history, you'll learn immediate bite-sized lessons from the book's first pages, replete with a ledger of 'Lies We Believe About the Man Who Could Not Tell Them' and lists of Washington's favorite things, animals, frenemies and pettiest acts. Here's why that's brilliant: You already know he won the American Revolution, and if you've listened to or seen 'Hamilton,' you know he did it with no navy and an army that was outgunned and outmanned.

"But did you know that Washington was a honey-obsessed surrogate father of four who named one of his dogs Cornwallis and ended up estranged from nearly every other revolutionary boldfaced name? After reading Coe's book, you feel like you know him -- his family, his desires, how he failed and grew and became the man who is on our money and inextricable from our national identity," Carr observed.

As immersed as Coe became in the life of Washington, she told Carr she wants to keep a little distance. "I know that a lot of biographers in the introduction to their books write about what they do on Washington's birthday or how they grew up with him or have a personal relationship with him," Coe noted. "I didn't have that -- and I really plan to keep it that way. Also, I promised my husband no more Washington." <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) It seemed perfect. Everything was going Donald Trump's way. Republican senators had refused to allow witnesses in his impeachment trial. They were expected to form a solid red line of defense. And the administration was even hoping some vulnerable Democrats might buck their party and vote to acquit the President.

Then came the stunner: Mitt Romney broke with his fellow Republicans and voted for Trump's removal from office. "He explained his decision in moving moral, ethical and patriotic terms," wrote Frida Ghitis. "Judging the President, he said, was 'the most difficult decision I ever faced.' But the judgment of history weighed heavily. He faced his responsibility with modesty and gravity...he found that 'what the President did was wrong, grievously wrong.'"

Romney thus became the first senator in American history to vote for removal of a president of his own party. And Democratic senator Doug Jones, who faces an uphill battle to retain his seat in strongly pro-Trump Alabama, also voted to remove Trump. "With their integrity, Romney and Jones defined themselves for future generations ," Ghitis wrote.

Trump was of course acquitted -- and had reason to celebrate, which he did on Thursday. But for the most part, it was not a smiling Trump the nation saw. He was furious with Romney. And with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. And still with the FBI director he fired, James Comey.

"Trump recapped the many investigations against him over the last three years and directed his vitriol at those who dared oppose him," wrote. "Instead of taking even a small measure of responsibility for a crisis that kicked off after he tried to enlist foreign election help in exchange for congressionally approved military aid for an ally at war, Trump demonstrated the pure essence of his narcissism and self-pity ." The President called his antagonists "evil and sick," D'Antonio noted.

David Axelrod. "He got caught red-handed and beat the rap, backed up by the base he long ago predicted would stick with him even if he committed a homicide on Fifth Avenue."

"He got caught red-handed and beat the rap, backed up by the base he long ago predicted would stick with him even if he committed a homicide on Fifth Avenue." (In the latest Axe Files podcast, Axelrod interviews CNN Political Commentator David Gergen .)

America has to worry, Axelrod wrote, about what "an unbridled and shameless President will do next."

It didn't take long to begin finding out.

Samantha Vinograd. In the days following Trump's acquittal, the administration fired Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman from his White House job and recalled Ambassador Gordon Sondland. Both had given testimony damaging to Trump in the House impeachment hearings. "After months of publicly smearing Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, it appears President Donald Trump took a final shot at a man who did nothing more than faithfully carry out the duties of his job -- and issued a warning shot to anyone else who dares question him ," wrote

Ruth Ben-Ghiat described this way: While officials said it was prompted by concern over "national security, in reality an authoritarian cocktail of spite, corruption and racism drives this decision -- Trump's team prohibited anyone living in New York State from applying for the Global Entry trusted traveler program, a stepdescribed this way: While officials said it was prompted by concern over "national security, in reality an authoritarian cocktail of spite, corruption and racism drives this decision -- one that will make America less secure and less efficient ."

Rick Hasen warned, "Now, with the Senate trial behind him, Election expertwarned, "Now, with the Senate trial behind him, the President can go right back to soliciting foreign interference in the 2020 elections ." He said Trump could lie about the results of the 2020 election if it goes against him and can confidently expect Senate Republicans to back him up in any disputed parts of the vote.

We've never seen a State of the Union like this

The day before Trump was acquitted in the Senate, he delivered his State of the Union speech. Befitting a reality show star, Trump bestowed a medal of freedom on a hugely controversial radio talk show host, promised a scholarship to a young student and reunited a military family, all while lauding his administration's record.

The reality part he didn't expect was House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's gif-worthy coda to the speech -- she grandly tore up the prepared text Trump had handed her.

Charlie Dent, a Republican, wrote that he was struck by " Former Rep., a Republican, wrote that he was struck by " the smallness and pettiness of the evening , starting with Trump ignoring House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's outstretched hand and ending with her tearing up the President's speech. Bad form on both counts ... The inappropriateness of Republicans chanting 'four more years' and Democrats scoffing and booing detracted significantly from what should be a dignified proceeding."

Trump's decision to honor Rush Limbaugh and have First Lady Melania Trump confer the Medal of Freedom on him during the speech alarmed Elliot Williams, who noted that Limbaugh "has devoted much of his career to belching out racist invective and dividing the country. He has a colossal audience and has been instrumental in fueling the vicious toxicity and knee-jerk partisanship that characterizes our moment."

Other recipients of the award, Williams noted, include: Elie Wiesel, Mother Teresa, Maya Angelou, Georgia O'Keeffe, Walt Disney, the Rev. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Neil Armstrong. We should wish for Limbaugh's recovery from his recent diagnosis of advanced lung cancer, Williams said, without endorsing "his long track record of using a global platform to dehumanize others."

Iowa fiasco

The first election night of the Democratic 2020 primary went very wrong, when Iowa party officials were unable to release any votes at all, due to technical snafus, including problems with a new vote reporting app.

"Maybe the fiasco of the late reporting results from the Iowa caucus this year will have a positive legacy," wrote Jeffrey Toobin. Another state, more representative of the party's diverse demographics should start the primary, he said.

"The caucuses are an embarrassment to the Democratic Party and the United States. This is no way to pick a nominee, " Toobin said, noting that the process doesn't allow for secret ballots or for voters who have evening jobs and other responsibilities that keep them from attending the caucuses."

Rick Santorum expressed admiration for the careful way Iowans assess the candidates, but he recounted his own experience of receiving very delayed word that he, and not Mitt Romney, had actually won the caucus in 2012. By the time officials made that determination, Santorum's chance to capitalize on momentum from Iowa was gone. But, he argued, " Former Sen.expressed admiration for the careful way Iowans assess the candidates, but he recounted his own experience of receiving very delayed word that he, and not Mitt Romney, had actually won the caucus in 2012. By the time officials made that determination, Santorum's chance to capitalize on momentum from Iowa was gone. But, he argued, " this system of tabulating the results and checking them twice is much fairer to the process and to the candidates than getting it wrong and keeping a lid on it."

Impeachment in hindsight

Doug Heye wrote that while impeachment lasts forever in the history books, its practical impact may be to re-elect Trump. He argued the President "has good reason to embark" on an exoneration tour.

(CNN) Democrats hoping to dislodge President Donald Trump from the White House before January 20, 2025 have only one more option -- the ballot box -- and the voting begins Monday in Iowa.

In the past week, it became clearer than ever that impeachment would not result in Trump's removal by the US Senate. After a motion to call witnesses was defeated Friday afternoon, Republicans are on track to conclude the trial -- despite new reporting by The New York Times that a forthcoming book by former national security adviser John Bolton backs up the allegations that Trump improperly withheld US aid to Ukraine.

The central question for the GOP,wrote, was: "Even if Bolton's account is fully accurate, does this episode, taken in its entirety, warrant the removal of a duly elected president?" Now, get ready for "a series of Trump campaign exoneration rallies as he travels the country hammering Democrats for their overreach ," Jennings said.

Trump's defense in the Senate was double-barreled: The lawyers denied that he conditioned military aid for Ukraine on an announcement of an investigation of the Bidens, and also contended that even if he did it, it wasn't an impeachable offense. To make the case,wrote, "Trump wanted a spectacle -- a vaudeville show of characters and personalities -- and from Jay Sekulow's theatrics to Alan Dershowitz's law school lecture, he got it.

noted that even though the President's plan to press the Ukrainians for an investigation announcement was foiled by a whistleblower's complaint "the President and his Republican colleagues found an alternative venue to smear Biden -- the floor of the United States Senate." One of Trump's lawyers, former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi, "aired all the charges against Biden without providing ample evidence to support any of them. She, and the rest of White House counsel, misled the Senate and the American people on the basic facts of the case ."

Aaron Rupar wrote," Vox'swrote," Shamelessness is a feature of Trumpism, not a bug. And while Pam Bondi's performance may seem laughable to most, it's been sufficient for Senate Republicans."

The Dershowitz doctrine

Another Trump lawyer, Alan Dershowitz, helped make Senate Republicans feel better about their effort to exonerate the President with an argument Democrats and many legal scholars labeled ridiculous: "If a President did something that he believes will help him get elected, in the public interest," he told Senate jurors, "that cannot be the kind of quid pro quo that results in impeachment."

Paul Begala observed, "I did not go to Harvard Law, but I did go to the University of Texas School of Law, where I studied criminal law and constitutional law, but observed, "I did not go to Harvard Law, but I did go to the University of Texas School of Law, where I studied criminal law and constitutional law, but never dreamed a legendary legal mind would set them both ablaze on the Senate floor . The Dershowitz Doctrine would make presidents immune from every criminal act, so long as they could plausibly claim they did it to boost their re-election effort."

John Avlon labeled it the "King Trump defense" and labeled it the "King Trump defense" and "an insult to our Constitution and separation of powers."

Aisha Moodie-Mills. "The impeachment process has provided Democrats The Trump defense arguments won't convince voters, wrote. "The impeachment process has provided Democrats with a treasure trove of damning evidence to fuel the campaign against him and convince voters that he should be evicted from the White House in the November election."

Kobe Bryant

A week ago, the world was stunned to learn of the death of NBA legend Kobe Bryant, in a helicopter crash that took the lives of his 13-year old daughter Gianna Bryant and seven other people.

"It makes no sense," wrote Jeff Pearlman. "It just doesn't compute, in the way JFK's death didn't compute for my parents; in the way Len Bias' death didn't compute for me at age 14."

As a young athlete, Bryant emerged as a complex character, Pearlman noted: "he possessed something few had witnessed before. Namely, a complete, total lack of self-doubt. " His "five NBA titles and 18 All-Star nods" would fully justify that confidence.

"He was famously accused of raping a Colorado hotel clerk in 2003, and the ensuing legal drama often felt O.J. Simpson-esque in scale and magnitude," Pearlman wrote. "For many, it seemed to signify the end of Kobe Bryant as a spokesperson, as a hero, as a star. Even after the case was settled out of court. How would anyone ever cheer for Kobe Bryant again? How would anyone believe in him?"

Edward Beck observed that Bryant's Catholic faith and fulsome apology were instrumental: "He was loved and forgiven by so many because they perceived Yet he started to put his life back together, centering it around family. Fatherobserved that Bryant's Catholic faith and fulsome apology were instrumental: "He was loved and forgiven by so many because they perceived an indefatigable man who accepted responsibility for his shortcomings.

"He wasn't simply an NBA legend, he was a cultural icon," Granderson wrote. "Bryant's death leaves a unique hole in our hearts."

It could take a year for investigators to pin down the cause of the crash. The pilot was experienced and the helicopter was a sophisticated craft, wrote retired airline pilot Les Abend. "Like all aviation accidents, this is an awful tragedy ."

On to Iowa

In what Jill Filipovic saw as a revealing remark, US Senator Joni Ernst drew a direct line from the impeachment trial's discussion of the Bidens to her home state of Iowa, where the Democratic primary voting begins Monday. "I'm really interested to see how this discussion today informs and influences the Iowa caucus voters, those Democratic caucus goers," Ernst said. "Will they be supporting VP Biden at this point?"

Iowa has traditionally played an outsized role in determining the front runners in the Democratic presidential primaries. But this year may be different, suggested Ian Sams, who was national press secretary on Sen. Kamala Harris' presidential campaign. A strong victory in Iowa can shape the narrative of a candidate's surging campaign, but new caucus rules providing for releasing three sets of results could confuse the picture. The caucus is already overshadowed by the impeachment drama and could be largely eclipsed by the spectacle of Trump's State of the Union speech Tuesday evening.

"Though Iowa's vote is important," Sams wrote, the "unique media environment could dampen its historic effect of crowning a front-runner and make later contests even more influential for how voters perceive the candidates and the race."

Now it's an emergency

Michael Bociurkiw Last weekend, wrote that it was "baffling" that the World Health Organization hadn't declared the Wuhan coronavirus a "public health emergency of international concern." But as cases continued to spread and airlines restricted travel to China, on Thursday WHO did exactly what Bociurkiw had suggested.

The full picture of the threat presented by the virus is still not known, but in addition to the health risks, it is fueling ugly stereotypes. "Across the internet," wrote Jeff Yang, "we've seen widespread eruptions of racist scapegoating, blaming Chinese for a disease that has so far only killed Chinese."

He added, "At the root of these reactions is something deeply insidious and very familiar. Throughout history, cultures have used ugly slurs on the savagery, backwardness or filthiness of foreigners as a way to rationalize excluding them, ejecting them or eliminating them ; we're seeing this today in the language that Trump and some in his administration often use to talk about Latin American migrants and other communities, framing them as bestial and subhuman, as violent and barbaric, as diseased and unclean, all to rationalize inhumane policies."

Trump's plan for the Middle East

Jared Kushner made the case for the proposal: " In the midst of the impeachment drama, President Trump unveiled a long-gestating plan to resolve the conflict in the Middle East, with the support of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his rival retired Lt. Gen. Benjamin Gantz. Trump senior advisermade the case for the proposal: " we have established a clear path to a final peace agreement that meets the core requirements of both the Israeli and Palestinian people."

Aaron David Miller, who helped craft a variety of peace plans over a long career in the US State Department, said the problems with the new plan are manifest. Trump's "deal of the century" , who helped craft a variety of peace plans over a long career in the US State Department, said the problems with the new plan are manifest. Trump's "deal of the century" is more accurately called the "steal of the century," he argued. It "reflects the triumph of presidential arrogance, domestic politics and pro-Israeli bias over any commitment to serious peacemaking, let alone an already fraught two-state solution which the administration seems determined to bury."

Mustafa Barghouti, secretary-general of the Palestinian National Initiative, was scathing in his criticism: "By far the most flagrant part of the plan , secretary-general of the Palestinian National Initiative, was scathing in his criticism: "By far the most flagrant part of the plan is that it ends any possibility for an independent sovereign Palestinian state , instead dividing the territories into ghettos and Bantustans, besieged, suffocated and isolated."

Superbowl star: Jennifer Lopez

At 50, Jennifer Lopez is continuing her remarkable comeback with a headliner role in the Superbowl half-time show. "Her star power is only growing stronger," wrote Holly Thomas.

Lopez's 2019 "got off to a rocky start. Her performance during a Motown tribute at the Grammys last February was widely regarded as being in poor taste, especially given that several big artists snubbed the event for rewarding too few black artists in major categories. It was embarrassing, but she shook it off," Thomas pointed out.

Her 50th birthday tour was a success, along with her starring role in "Hustlers."

"While other actors might balk at the thought of playing an aging stripper with a near-savage hunger for money," Thomas wrote, "Lopez not only seized the opportunity, but suggested the now-legendary pole dance scene which was her character's introduction. She took the role -- and the producer gig -- for free. As she later explained, 'I bank on myself.' It paid off." <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) In 2020 America, members of the two political tribes can largely go their own ways without having to pay attention to the other side. Except for last week: The Republican controlled Senate had to sit silently and listen to the Democrats as they methodically made their case that President Donald Trump should be removed from office.

Fidget spinners spun. Milk was served. A crossword puzzles and doodle were spotted. But for the most part, senators followed the rules. One tough one: no phones or other digital devices. It was a "digital detox,"observed, something "most of us could use."

The most surprising moment came when President Trump's staunch defender Sen. Lindsey Graham paused at the elevator to congratulate Rep. Adam Schiff, who led the House impeachment managers presenting the case against Trump. The South Carolina senator told reporters Schiff was "well spoken" and "did a good job." But that doesn't mean Schiff won over Graham or anyone else on the GOP side.

On Saturday, the tables were turned as Democrats had to listen to the President's lawyers begin their defense. Their arguments,wrote, ran "the gamut from marginally convincing (at best) to transparently flimsy, outright misleading and disingenuous ."

Where's the trial heading? "It is crucial for the Democrats' case for Trump's removal to establish the danger of inviting foreign interference in American elections," wrote. "But partisan politics stands in the way. Republican senators appear to have decided to protect Trump at all costs ."

Raul Reyes called it "masterful: it was eloquent, thoughtful and -- Graham was far from the only one praising Schiff's presentation.called it "masterful: it was eloquent, thoughtful and -- most importantly -- restrained . While he invoked everyone from Alexander Hamilton to John F. Kennedy, he never slipped into histrionics or hyperbole, which any trial lawyer knows can backfire. Instead, he methodically went through a timeline of the President's alleged improper conduct."

Scott Jennings didn't buy the Democrats' argument: "Schiff's reckless statements in the runup to the Mueller report and now this week's impeachment arguments were a continuation of the Democratic emotion to never concede the 2016 election -- and to never acknowledge the legitimacy of a man they detest," Jennings wrote. "Schiff is, in effect, At the same time, Republican commentators likedidn't buy the Democrats' argument: "Schiff's reckless statements in the runup to the Mueller report and now this week's impeachment arguments were a continuation of the Democratic emotion to never concede the 2016 election -- and to never acknowledge the legitimacy of a man they detest," Jennings wrote. "Schiff is, in effect, arguing that America's political institutions have already failed and will fail again unless a singular individual is no longer allowed to exist in the system."

Jennings argued that Schiff was playing into the hands of Russia's President Vladimir Putin in destabilizing American democracy, while Louis and others made the case that it was Trump's conduct in the Ukraine affair that helped accomplish Putin's goals.

'No magic wand' against deadly virus

In 2003, journalist Laurie Garrett covered the spread of the SARS virus as it reached "37 countries, sickening 8,098 people and killing 774 of them." The news of this year's Wuhan coronavirus outbreak gave her "a chilling sense of déjà vu."

In the wake of the new virus' outbreak, China is restricting travel, closing off Beijing's Forbidden City and parts of the Great Wall and shutting movie theaters. And other nations, including the US, are seeing the first cases of the virus.

"While 17 years has brought significant improvements in virology, diagnostics development, international health regulations and the WHO, and we know more today about the nCoV2019 virus (as the Wuhan coronavirus is awkwardly dubbed) than we did one month into the SARS epidemic, there is no magic wand that can wave this highly dispersed, airborne-spread, human-to-human transmitting microbe away," Garrett wrote.

"Beijing is now executing the playbook that ultimately stopped SARS. The city of Wuhan is now on lockdown and fever checkpoints are operating in most major transit hubs across the country while Lunar New Year celebrations have been canceled. Instant contagious quarantine, 1,000-bed facilities are under construction, with one due to open next week outside Wuhan."

'Nobody likes him'

In a new documentary, Hillary Clinton blasted her former primary opponent Sen. Bernie Sanders: "Nobody likes him, nobody wants to work with him, he got nothing done. He was a career politician," Clinton said. "It's all just baloney and I feel so bad that people got sucked into it."

In an interview with the Hollywood Reporter, Clinton wouldn't even promise to back Sanders if he wins the Democratic nomination this year, although she later said she would back whoever wins the primary. Sanders noted "on a good day, my wife likes me, so let's clear the air on that one." (It's not hard to imagine Larry David saying that on one of his SNL impersonations of Sanders.)

Jill Filipovic took Clinton's part, mostly: took Clinton's part, mostly: "Clinton is finally being her authentic self," she wrote "and it turns out that she's a human being with normal human emotions. She is angry at someone she perhaps rightly sees as contributing to her stunning loss in 2016, and the ushering-in of one of the most dangerous presidents in American history. We say we want female politicians, and prominent women generally, to be authentic and honest."

Filipovic said that at a time when Donald Trump is president, waffling on supporting Sanders if he wins the primary is "wildly reckless," but Clinton is not wrong "about the online culture that has coalesced around Sanders — it indeed can be toxic, and often misogynist, and just plain uglier, more aggressive, and more venomous than anything else you see on the left side of the political aisle."

The founders, the framers -- and Trump

Joseph Ellis has devoted his career as a historian to studying the USA's founding generation. He won the Pulitzer Prize for his book on the founders and the National Book Award for his biography of Thomas Jefferson. This week he brought it all to the question of impeachment.

When the framers of the Constitution met in Philadelphia in 1787, Ellis wrote, they were "haunted by conversations that had occurred in that very same room 11 years earlier, in July 1776" when representatives of the American colonies gathered to declare their independence from the tyranny they argued resulted from British rule. "The ghost at the banquet was George III."

"Trump's chief offense is his own defense," wrote Ellis. "Namely, that as president he cannot be indicted, convicted or investigated, and has no legal obligation to provide documents or witnesses when requested by the House or Senate. That means President Trump is claiming he is an elected monarch who is above the law."

Nullifying the checks and balances spelled out in the Constitution and failing to grant that Congress is a coequal branch of government would be fatal to American democracy, Ellis observed. "For in doing so we are siding with George III rather than Thomas Jefferson. We are saying that the American Revolution was a mistake. We are announcing that we are no longer a republic. And that, so it seems to me, is self-evidently a price not worth paying."

Mystery of the jet fuel dump

Retired pilot Les Abend noted that there are still questions about the January 14 dumping of "thousands of pounds of jet fuel at a too-low altitude over a populated area that included six Los Angeles schools at recess, dousing children and others." Teachers at one of the schools sued Delta and the FAA is investigating.

"Aviation officials were surprised at the pilots' decision—particularly because in their transmission to air traffic control when they requested return, the pilots asserted that they would not need to dump fuel ." Abend said we should wait for the results of the investigation to know for certain. But one of his remarks stands out: "Assuming that an immediate return wasn't necessary, if the pilots had told controllers that dumping was required, the flight likely would have been vectored out over the ocean to an area where the fuel particles would, for example, not land on people."

Dollars for doughnuts

Buying several boxes of gourmet donuts and then tweeting a picture of himself carrying them out was by no means Justin Trudeau's biggest recent stumble. But it sure annoyed some of his fellow Canadians who, when it comes to donuts, worship at the shrine of Tim Hortons. Michael Bociurkiw noted that the donuts at the Winnipeg store "Oh Doughnuts" cost as much as $4.25 Canadian each (for the "gluten friendly" kind).

"It didn't help that he committed this sin at a Liberal cabinet retreat in Winnipeg, a predominantly working-class, central Canadian prairie city," wrote Bociurkiw, a Canadian who worked there as a reporter for a year. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) It's been more than two decades since a President of the United States went on trial in the Senate. Then it was Bill Clinton, today it is Donald Trump. And as different as the two impeachments are, there are some common elements. One that surprised many was Trump's choice this week of Kenneth Starr as one of his defense lawyers. Starr led the controversial investigation of Clinton's relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky that provided the impetus for the impeachment.

At trial in the Senate in 1999, Clinton won a resounding acquittal. So why, some wondered, would Trump pick Starr to help defend him?

"But the rest of the country will get a real window into the character of our President. Rather than mount a defense of his conduct with the best legal team, he's choosing a group mired in controversies including scandal, corruption, and misogyny. The majority of America, in my view, will be repulsed. But they won't be surprised. The President let us know who he was when he stepped off that Access Hollywood bus. And now he's picked a legal team that has no problem at all with it."

Another new member of the team, Alan Dershowitz, argued Friday that "abuse of power" is not an impeachable offense, noted. "Based on the Constitution, and what we know of the founders, Dershowitz's thoroughly Nixonian claims are wrong. The founders created a system of democracy explicitly meant to check any single branch of government from accumulating excessive power and authority."

The oath

William Rehnquist, the chief justice who presided over Clinton's impeachment trial, appeared in the Senate chamber back then wearing four gold stripes on the sleeves of his judicial robe, a look he had adopted a few years earlier from a local production of Gilbert and Sullivan's "Iolanthe."

So when current Chief Justice John Roberts arrived Thursday to take an oath and administer it to the full Senate at the start of Trump's trial, some were disappointed to see that he wore only a plain black robe.

The trial involves a lot of choices that are much more serious than the sartorial.

Will there be witnesses? What is the meaning of the oath requiring senators to "do impartial justice?" Will newly disclosed evidence be considered? And will the chief justice actively intervene -- or follow Rehnquist's ceremonial approach to the job?

Michael Zeldin wrote that the nature of the trial "requires that all relevant witness and documentary evidence that bears on the guilt or innocence of the impeached officeholder be brought forth and evaluated. This occurs every day in criminal trials across America, and has been the norm in every other impeachment trial conducted by the Senate. wrote that the nature of the trial "requires that all relevant witness and documentary evidence that bears on the guilt or innocence of the impeached officeholder be brought forth and evaluated. This occurs every day in criminal trials across America, and has been the norm in every other impeachment trial conducted by the Senate. The oath requires nothing less ."

Dean Obeidallah noted. "And in President Bill Clinton's 1999 impeachment trial, three witnesses were called to testify." But it's an open question whether there will be enough votes in the GOP-controlled Senate to call even one witness. (In Obeidallah's view, the one witness America really needs to hear from is the one who knows the most about what happened: In the first presidential impeachment trial, that of President Andrew Johnson in 1868, " 41 witnesses were called : 25 by the prosecution and 16 by the defense,"noted. "And in President Bill Clinton's 1999 impeachment trial, three witnesses were called to testify." But it's an open question whether there will be enough votes in the GOP-controlled Senate to call even one witness. (In Obeidallah's view, the one witness America really needs to hear from is the one who knows the most about what happened: President Trump .)

Mike Pence invoked the Andrew Johnson trial in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece, calling on Democrats to follow the example of Senator Edmund Ross Jeremi Suri said that if Pence had looked further into the story of Ross, he would have learned that historians believe the senator essentially sold his vote for favors. Vice Presidentinvoked the Andrew Johnson trial in a Wall Street Journal opinion piece, calling on Democrats to follow the example of Senator Edmund Ross who voted against removing the president. said that if Pence had looked further into the story of Ross, he would have learned that historians believe the senator essentially sold his vote for favors.

"No one believed that Ross was a man of conscience or principle," Suri observed. " He used his vote to benefit himself. And he protected a president who did everything he could to prevent the enforcement of the Constitution's protections for African American civil rights, as stipulated in the 14th Amendment and the Civil Rights Act of 1866."

Enter Lev Parnas

In a round of television interviews this week, Lev Parnas, an indicted associate of Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani, asserted that Trump knew all about the effort to extract a political favor from Ukraine's president in return for announcing an investigation that would harm former vice president Joe Biden's candidacy.

Frida Ghitis: " If Parnas is to be believed, the President's withholding of US aid from Ukraine wasn't about fighting corruption but about re-electing Trump in 2020, observed: " It all fits with the rest of Trump's behavior, his payment of hush money to cover up alleged sexual encounters, his mob lingo to insult former friends -- remember when he called Michael Cohen a 'rat' -- his browbeating and intimidation of aides?"

Asha Rangappa noted that "Trump finally got Ukraine to noted that "Trump finally got Ukraine to announce an investigation — though not the one he was hoping for." The Interior Ministry said it would examine alleged surveillance of the former US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, "by people linked to Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani," Rangappa wrote.

Paul Callan. The House committees' investigation "was terminated before court rulings could have affirmed the legitimacy of congressional subpoena power. Instead, the House rushed its investigation and compounded the problem by stalling the transfer of the articles of impeachment to the Senate. Yet Parnas' statements and documents provided by his lawyer are unlikely to sway the outcome of the impeachment trial, wrote. The House committees' investigation "was terminated before court rulings could have affirmed the legitimacy of congressional subpoena power. Instead, the House rushed its investigation and compounded the problem by stalling the transfer of the articles of impeachment to the Senate. Meanwhile, the public lost interest ."

Adam Raymond in New York Magazine. "As he later put, quoting Iolanthe, It's a good bet that the defense lawyers and the House managers making the case for impeachment will attract more controversy than John Roberts. In the Clinton impeachment, Rehnquist's decision to wear stripes "was among the most consequential decisions he made at the trial," wrotein New York Magazine. "As he later put, quoting Iolanthe, 'I did nothing in particular, and I did it very well.'

It's getting tense

The lasting takeaway from the Democratic debate in Iowa may be what happened the moment it ended.

Senator Elizabeth Warren walked over to Senator Bernie Sanders, declined to shake his hand and said, "I think you called me a liar on national TV."

David Axelrod was not surprised. The former advisor to President Barack Obama wrote, "a clash between these erstwhile allies, who avoided confrontation throughout 2019, seemed inevitable. was not surprised. The former advisor to President Barack Obama wrote, "a clash between these erstwhile allies, who avoided confrontation throughout 2019, seemed inevitable. And it's a sure sign that voting is near ."

He knows whereof he speaks: Axelrod described a bitter exchange between presidential rivals Obama and Hillary Clinton in December 2007, as they also were angling for a strong showing in the early primary voting.

Asked to meet for a brief conversation with Clinton when the two candidates found themselves at a Washington airport en route to an Iowa debate, Obama sought and received an apology for the negative remarks of a Clinton supporter, Axelrod recalled. "But when Obama raised other actions by her campaign he felt were out of bounds, Clinton became incensed and disgorged her own litany of complaints about our campaign tactics." Clinton later served in Obama's administration and he endorsed her candidacy for president in 2016.

Carl Gibson and David Weissman: " Sanders and Warren should also patch it up, wroteand: " There's far too much at stake for progressives who support Sanders and Warren to allow their own personal preferences for any one candidate to jeopardize progressives' chances to win the White House."

Scott Jennings was hoping for some more fireworks. "Why do the Democrats just stand there and let things happen to themselves," he asked. "Biden is ahead nationally, and nobody did anything to stop him. Warren is effectively calling Sanders a backwoods misogynist and he slinked off into a corner. Republicanwas hoping for some more fireworks. "Why do the Democrats just stand there and let things happen to themselves," he asked. "Biden is ahead nationally, and nobody did anything to stop him. Warren is effectively calling Sanders a backwoods misogynist and he slinked off into a corner. How do these folks hope to get the nomination or win the White House in such a pitiful crouch?

Aisha C. Moodie Mills wrote that " wrote that " missing from the conversation are a range of issues that would ... speak to the hearts and interests of the Democratic base." She asked on Twitter about the issues people want to "hear more about." Among them: "voting rights; election protection; criminal justice reform; immigration and family separation; the future of work; curbing the rise of white nationalist terrorism; women's rights and reproductive health; gun control...LGBTQ rights -- and the list goes on."

Bloomberg: Why Iowa?

Michael Bloomberg's last-minute campaign, funded by the billionaire entrepreneur and former New York City mayor, is skipping the Iowa caucus and the three other first primary states, and focusing on the March primaries. Last week, he went one step further by arguing in a CNN Opinion piece that it was a major mistake for the party to begin the voting with two states, Iowa and New Hampshire, that lack the diversity of the Democrats' national base.

"The problem is compounded by the fact that the two early voting states are unlikely to be consequential in the general election. So as a party, we are spending all of our time and resources outside of the battleground states we need to win ," wrote Bloomberg. "Meanwhile, President Trump is spending his time in Michigan, Wisconsin, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Florida, and North Carolina -- all states we lost in 2016 by razor-thin margins."

" The only way out of this crisis is through diplomacy -- clear-eyed, hard-nosed diplomacy grounded in strategy, that's not about one-off decisions or one-upmanship."

Bernie Sanders and Rep. Ro Khanna wrote, "We are feeling a sense of déjà vu right now. A Republican administration is lying to the American people about the 'imminent threat' posed by a Middle Eastern country. The vice president is falsely claiming that the government in question is linked to the perpetrators of the September 11 attacks. Hawkish lawmakers in Washington accuse voices of restraint of 'strengthening our enemies' and being 'in love with terrorists.' "

A similar frenzy, they argued, took hold before the Bush administration attacked Iraq President Saddam Hussein's regime in 2003, which they called "the worst foreign policy disaster in modern American history."

The bravest woman

Evelyn Yang, who's married to presidential candidate Andrew Yang, spoke powerfully in an interview with CNN's Dana Bash about the repeated sexual abuse she says her obstetrician committed against her and many other women -- and the failure of authorities to ensure that he could no longer practice medicine after the first complaints emerged.

Anushay Hossain. "Yang's sheer courage is undeniable, but it also made me think of the unmitigated horror she went through, how hard she fought even as both medical and criminal justice institutions apparently failed her, and how purely fearless she is "I cried as I forced myself to get through reading this woman's story," wrote. "Yang's sheer courage is undeniable, but it also made me think of the unmitigated horror she went through, how hard she fought even as both medical and criminal justice institutions apparently failed her, and how purely fearless she is not only to share her story now but continue to give a voice to survivors ."

Social justice crusader

Monday is Martin Luther King Jr. Day, a holiday set aside to remember the great champion of civil rights who was assassinated in 1968. But which Martin Luther King does America honor?

Historian Peniel Joseph suggested that political leaders "embrace the most seemingly non-threatening aspects of King's legacy, namely his Christian religious faith and philosophy of non-violence. Turning King into a sanctified figure shorn of rough political edges allows us to celebrate the civil rights movement as a children's bedtime story, one with a happy ending."

It's impossible to reckon fully with King unless you understand his commitment to achieving social justice, Joseph noted. "The most powerful way Americans can honor King now is through the pursuit of new national voting rights legislation that ends voter suppression, ID laws, allows prisoners to vote and automatically registers every 18-year-old citizen to vote."

Cheaters win?

Major League Baseball delivered a stunning report on cheating by the 2017 world champion Houston Astros, and heads rolled. Managers of three teams (two of whom formerly worked for the Astros) were axed, as was the Astros' general manager.

But no players were disciplined, to sports columnist Mike Downey's chagrin. "Trouble is, nobody took away their loot. The championship trophy is still theirs. The banner can still wave. ... Not a single Houston player ... has gotten the heave-ho or lost a red cent. Everybody's free to report back for duty in 2020, either with the Astros or whomever their current employers might be. No suspensions, no recriminations, no accomplishments rescinded, no records corrected, no asterisks next to their stats."

Big Ben: No comment

Big Ben, the iconic bell in London's Elizabeth Tower, has long been rung when the UK marks big occasions, including the London Olympics, the new year and "the state funerals of monarchs on three occasions, a toll per year of each of their lives," observed Holly Thomas.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson thought it only fitting that it also should toll on January 31, "Brexit" day, when his nation leaves the EU.

The problem: Big Ben is being renovated and it would cost about 500,000 pounds to get it to toll for this special occasion. Johnson proposed "bung a bob for a Big Ben bong" -- a special collection from the public to pay for it, and he chipped in some of his own money.

But emotions are still raw over Brexit, Thomas wrote: "Across the country, bells have become an emblem of victory for some, yet another waste of breath for many, and an outright insult for others ."

In the face of doubts and opposition, Johnson's office backed away from the plan Thursday. There will be other "events" to mark the day ... and Big Ben will get the day off. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) Some cracks emerged last week in the formerly solid wall of Republican support for President Donald Trump. They were small in number -- and dwarfed by the vast pro-Trump majority on the right. Whether they will matter in the long run is another question. But they were surprising nonetheless:

Rep. Matt Gaetz, whom GQ has called the "Trumpiest congressman," was among three Republicans voting for a resolution Thursday to require Trump to gain congressional approval for any more military action against Iran. He joined the Democrats who, as historianput it, "are shining a bright light on abuses of presidential military power."

GOP Sen. Mike Lee of Utah called a Wednesday briefing from Trump administration officials after the killing of Iranian General Qasem Soleimani the "worst briefing I've had on a military issue" during his nine years in the Senate and called it "un-American" and "unacceptable." Sen. Rand Paul agreed: "An insult to the Constitution," he told reporters.

And Fox News host Tucker Carlson, who Trump has called one of his "great, great friends in the media," lambasted the President's decision to approve the drone strike that killed Soleimani in Iraq.wrote, "This is the worst possible time for Trump to have cracks in his base."

Trump's alternately warlike and conciliatory approach to Iran is confusing everyone, noted Peter Bergen. "The President's gyrations on the Middle East have been head-spinning."

Trump "has gone back and forth on Iran," approving the Soleimani killing, "while also at the last minute calling off a military operation in June against targets in Iran, and then offering to sit down with the Iranians without preconditions...As a result of these myriad reversals, it's hard for both America's allies and enemies to discern any stable strategy in the greater Middle East ."

David Andelman. "Perhaps most troubling is the fact that Trump "This time, the United States stands utterly alone," observed. "Perhaps most troubling is the fact that Trump does not seem to be at all concerned about his lack of friends and allies ...above all, he does not seem to have an exit strategy or end game in mind."

Frida Ghitis wrote, "The immediate aftermath of the Soleimani killing was an embarrassment of chaotic mixed messages and disorganization. Trump is right that Americans should be grateful this didn't quickly escalate, because by all appearances the administration was ill-prepared." Iran launched a retaliatory missile attack against bases where Americans are stationed but there were no reported casualties.

It's not over, Ghitis warned: "Iran will further retaliate for Soleimani's killing . The retaliation may come from the Quds Force he ran or, more likely, from one of the terrorist groups or militias he helped build across the Middle East."

Eric Swalwell, a Democrat from California, wrote that Trump " Rep., a Democrat from California, wrote that Trump " has forfeited the benefit of the doubt by barraging us with lies on matters involving Russia, by throwing our own intelligence community and public servants under the bus when they contradict him and by ignoring our military experts' advice whenever it fails to fit into his personal political goals."

Samantha Vinograd. Trump had to invoke the work of intelligence agencies to justify the strike, but these are the same ones that he has attacked as being unreliable arms of the "deep state," noted

'Startling admission' in air disaster

After several days of denial, Iran admitted that it was responsible for the firing of a missile that brought down a Ukrainian International Airlines passenger plane, killing all 176 on board shortly after takeoff from Imam Khomeini Airport in Iran Wednesday.

As Michael Bociurkiw noted, the disaster bore strong similarities to the 2014 downing of Malaysian Airlines Flight 17 which crashed in Ukraine after it was hit by Russian-made missiles, killing 298 people.

The difference this time: "Iranian authorities have done something the Russian government has never mustered the courage to do...More than five years later, the Kremlin has yet to acknowledge any responsibility for the tragic downing of the flight from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur." He said "Iran's startling admission" likely came because "authorities in Tehran felt they could no longer maintain theories of a technical failure and other lines of deniability in the face of overwhelming evidence gathered by western intelligence agencies."

Pelosi to McConnell: 'Get ready'

Trump was said to be angry at the Democrats' passage of the War Powers resolution, but he can afford to laugh off the few Republican voices criticizing him as long as the Senate's GOP majority sticks together when Speaker Nancy Pelosi sends over the two articles of impeachment.

Scott Jennings. Former Trump national security adviser John Bolton, who now says he would heed a Senate subpoena, should have been called as a witness by the House, in Jennings' view. " Democrats "failed to convince a single Republican in the House that impeachment was necessary," wrote. Former Trump national security adviser John Bolton, who now says he would heed a Senate subpoena, should have been called as a witness by the House, in Jennings' view. " This could not have gone more poorly if the Democrats had tried ...Better to let the people decide Trump's fate in November than allow the Washington partisans to try in January."

Lawyers Michael Zeldin and Robert Ray, both former independent counsels, tangled over whether the Senate should call witnesses, including Bolton. "If the Senate does not call Bolton and the other witnesses with firsthand knowledge of the President's actions, it would be facilitating a coverup, and this is how history will record it," wrote Zeldin.

Ray's reply: "Only when there is clear and unmistakable evidence of impeachable crimes also constituting an abuse of the public trust will there ever be the requisite bipartisan support to remove a president from office. Anything short of that is contrary to the best interests of the country and can await the next election. In short, you don't need witnesses and further documents in order to figure that one out ."

A shocking new low

Rep. Doug Collins wasn't alone in suggesting that Democrats had sympathy for Soleimani, but his rhetoric was particularly extreme. Preet Bharara noted that Collins said Democrats "are in love with terrorists. We see that they mourn Soleimani more than they mourn our Gold Star families."

Bharara wrote in an open letter to Collins on Thursday: "I realize that you are a politician and that hyperbolic, hyperpartisan claptrap is the unfortunate fashion of the day. But even allowing for the new normal of nastiness in political rhetoric, your casual slur of countless good Americans hits a new bottom. Americans can, in good faith, differ about the legality or efficacy of killing Soleimani. That doesn't make them unpatriotic or lovers of terrorists. It is hostility to differences of opinion that is un-American ."

But also joining in the chorus of Republicans claiming Democrats had mourned the passing of Soleimani was former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley. The truth, wrote Jill Filipovic: "Not a single Democratic leader, candidate or other politician, 'mourned' Soleimani or expressed sadness over the man's death. To the contrary: They nearly to a one noted that he was a vicious actor, a man with the blood of thousands on his hands."

Haley "may well be angling to replace Mike Pence as Vice President, as some have suggested. She may just be seeking continued relevance in a Republican Party that increasingly hews to the chaos, anger and contempt of Trumpism...she has now firmly and permanently ceded any claim she ever had to high ground ," Filipovic said.

Last debate before Iowa

With three weeks to go before the Democratic presidential primary voting finally begins in Iowa, six candidates will take to the stage Tuesday in a debate sponsored by CNN and The Des Moines Register, the last DNC sanctioned debate before the caucus. Among them is Sen. Amy Klobuchar who has been focusing on Iowa and who some proclaimed the winner of the last debate.

David Perry, who's based in Klobuchar's home state, wrote that she "doesn't just win elections in Minnesota -- she crushes them. Even as political control in Minnesota has swung back and forth between Republicans and Democrats ... Klobuchar won by over 20 points in 2006, an incredible 35 points in 2012, and 24 points in 2018. She runs far ahead of her Democratic comrades on the statewide ticket, clearly attracting numerous Republican-leaning voters comfortable with splitting their ticket in her favor. She's made that success her calling card in the 2020 presidential primary" but still isn't in the top rank of Democrats in the primary polls.

To gain more traction, Klobuchar needs to make her case to progressive voters, Perry said. "I'd like to know whether there's a positive centrist vision for America beyond the premise that it will be easier to achieve ."

Julian Zelizer, "a surprise victory or a second-place finish from anyone other than Joe Biden — who still leads the national polls among Democrats — will be seen as When Iowans vote in the February 3 caucus, wrote, "a surprise victory or a second-place finish from anyone other than Joe Biden — who still leads the national polls among Democrats — will be seen as a game-changing moment that will generate extensive media coverage and attract a significant fundraising boost."

300 days and counting

It's been more than 300 days since the White House had a regular press briefing, which was a standard feature in prior administrations.

Having such briefings would help the administration and the American people immeasurably, particularly in a time of crisis, wrote a group of 13 former press secretaries, foreign service and military officials, from Republican as well as Democratic administrations. "Americans want to know the latest developments and seek the truth. On social media, wild rumors can fly, and our adversaries can manipulate disinformation to their advantage. This is now well documented," they wrote.

AND...

The Queen was livid

Kate Maltby wrote for CNN Opinion about the harsh criticism Meghan Markle had been receiving in the UK press. Maltby attributed it in part to the "absurd and anachronistic" royal system. "If Meghan and Harry want to be truly radical, Last February, English criticwrote for CNN Opinion about the harsh criticism Meghan Markle had been receiving in the UK press. Maltby attributed it in part to the "absurd and anachronistic" royal system. "If Meghan and Harry want to be truly radical, perhaps they should walk away completely.

This week, they started down that path, by announcing a plan to step away from some royal duties and live part of the year in North America.

In a new piece, Maltby applauded the move but said it doesn't go far enough: "It's still hard for many British progressives to rally round Harry as a champion of a new liberal monarchy. Especially when he and Meghan seem determined to remain in the royal family -- but entirely on their own terms. Brits who struggle to pay the rent will have laughed outright to see them talk about working toward 'financial independence,' given the significant inheritance he received from his aristocratic mother, Princess Diana, and great-grandmother the Queen Mother. The 'Duchy of Cornwall,' from which comes much of the income Prince Charles donates to his sons, is an old feudal fiefdom."

Incidentally, the announcement by Harry and Meghan seems to have blindsided the Queen and Prince Charles, Harry's father. As Maltby noted, "The BBC reported that Buckingham Palace is 'disappointed' -- Britspeak for "the Queen is livid."

Ever since the couple announced their engagement, wrote Peggy Drexler, the UK tabloid media "has blasted and belittled her , hardly ever forgetting to identify her as a divorced American actress with a black mother.

"Race, in fact, has been a huge factor," Drexler noted. "One of the earliest pieces, which ran in the Daily Mail, declared, 'Harry's girl is (almost) straight outta Compton' and painted her hometown as 'plagued by crime and riddled with street gangs.' It 'couldn't be more different to London's leafy Kensington,' the piece read...

(CNN) Every year, we ask a select group of our contributors to make a round of predictions about the year to come.

While last year's prognosticators failed to correctly predict much -- most of them thought former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke would emerge as the likely Democratic nominee, for example -- we decided to give them another chance to prove themselves. To focus their attention, we provided a list of 10 questions, highlighting some of the biggest political, cultural and sports-related events on the calendar. And there was a surprising amount of consensus among our oracles.

Let's start with politics. Half of our contributors believe Donald J. Trump will win reelection. As, our only contributor to successfully predict Trump's win in 2016 , wrote, "The Dow is up, unemployment is at an all-time low and we are slowly ending many of our overseas wars. While the Democrats and the media focus on impeachment, the voters will focus on the economy ."

Others believed Trump's prospect for reelection is not just about his economic successes; it's also about the left-leaning ideas that some of the leading Democrats are espousing, one contributor argued. SE Cupp said Democrats look like they are running for "president of Progressivia" -- not president of the United States.

Still, a few commentators were willing to give Joe Biden a fighting chance. " No malarkey here ," wrote, "Joe Biden will be elected president of the United States, propelled by his appeal to Midwestern voters." He, like many Democrats supporting Biden in the primary, seems to believe that the former vice president is the party's best chance against Trump. (And polls, far ahead of the actual voting, give Biden an edge .)

The arts and culture offerings we can't refuse

Joey Jackson and Scott Jennings predicted that Ariana Grande's "Thank U, Next" album would take home the Grammy for album of the year. To cite Jackson, " While our commentators largely made their presidential predictions down party lines, they came together on entertainment. Bothandpredicted that Ariana Grande's "Thank U, Next" album would take home the Grammy for album of the year. To cite Jackson, " there is no denying that she is a superstar!"

And six of our prognosticators put their money on Lizzo's "Cuz I Love You." As Roxanne Jones explained, "with her empowering message, funky flute playing and fun performances," Lizzo stands out from the crowd. Or, as Jeff Yang succinctly stated, "This is Lizzo's year; we're just living in it."

But Lizzo is not the only superstar predicted to clean up the award shows in 2020. Martin Scorsese appears likely to win the Oscar for his latest film, "The Irishman," according to seven of our contributors. This cinematic work, wrote Callan, "will prove to be an offer the Academy cannot refuse."

Still, several of our oracles put their money on Todd Phillips' "Joker." While it is rare for the Academy to award its highest honor to a film based on a comic book, James Gagliano argued that "a dynamite script, coupled with Joaquin Phoenix's captivating turn as a tortured soul" may just be enough to upend tradition.

American sports, the great uniter

Holly Thomas, our lone British commentator, wrote, " What's more unifying than the arts? Sports, apparently. Every single contributor predicted that the United States would take home the most medals at the Summer Olympics in Tokyo. Even, our lone British commentator, wrote, " America! The pool of athletes is massive ."

Back at home, more than half of our contributors thought the Baltimore Ravens would win Super Bowl LIV, and several attributed the potential win to the team's star quarterback Lamar Jackson. Gagliano said, "with ... Jackson as quarterback, (the Ravens) look pretty unstoppable right now." And several commentators, including Dean Obeidallah, wrote that if their preferred team could not win, they would be satisfied -- so long as the New England Patriots lost.

The disdain for Boston teams was not limited to football. Nearly half of our contributors said the New York Yankees would win the World Series, giving the metaphorical middle finger to Fenway Park. "Sure, they fell short in 2019, but it's a whole new ball game next year," argued Jones.

Alice Stewart begged to differ: After they beat the Yankees this year, advancing to the World Series, the Houston Astros are well positioned to go for the glory again in 2020. And she added, with a "fun pitcher" and "great team leader" like Justin Verlander, they will undoubtedly come out victorious this time.

'The most compelling voice on the most important issue'

Frida Ghitis. The other likely victor in 2020? Swedish climate activist Greta Thunberg, considered a strong contender for the Nobel Peace Prize. "As climate-change fueled storms and fires batter the Earth, Thunberg's passion will win hearts, minds and the prize," wrote

Charlotte Alter, Suyin Haynes and Justin Worland, Time reporters, wrote that she was given the honor because, "By clarifying an abstract danger with piercing outrage, Thunberg became the most compelling voice on the most important issue facing the planet." In fact, her passion already has scored. Time Magazine named her Person of the Year at the end of 2019.and, Time reporters, wrote that she was given the honor because, "By clarifying an abstract danger with piercing outrage, Thunberg became the most compelling voice on the most important issue facing the planet."

Jennings, however, thinks the top peace prize belongs to the latest arrival in the "Star Wars" franchise -- Baby Yoda. "Any other answer," he wrote, "is incorrect." And Jennings' logic makes some sense. Memes of Baby Yoda, which , however, thinks the top peace prize belongs to the latest arrival in the "Star Wars" franchise -- Baby Yoda. "Any other answer," he wrote, "is incorrect." And Jennings' logic makes some sense. Memes of Baby Yoda, which have circulated widely on the internet, bring an immediate sense of happiness and serenity.

As we enter what is likely to be one of the most contentious news cycles yet, we could all use a bit of serenity.

The day after the 2020 presidential election

Hard as it may be to envision a world beyond Trump's impeachment trial and the 2020 presidential election, we can and we must try. Why? Because when November 4, 2020 arrives, we will have little choice but to find a path forward.

Danny Fulton of Bremerton, Washington, told us that "political ideologies may shape us and drive our passion but they do not define us," and we must instead turn our attention to what unites us. Luckily, after devoting an entire series to the issue of political division, we have a set of solutions -- several of which we must credit to our devoted readers of Bremerton, Washington, told us that "political ideologies may shape us and drive our passion but they do not define us," and we must instead turn our attention to what unites us.

And Fulton has used those mutual points of fandom to form friendships with Washingtonians across the political spectrum. In fact, he recently had dinner with a liberal friend -- they both made sure to bring their lightsaber chopsticks with them.

Ken Burns advocated we take our shared interests one step further and dare to share stories of our lives and experiences with each other. "We all have stories. Documentary filmmakeradvocated we take our shared interests one step further and dare to share stories of our lives and experiences with each other. "We all have stories. And sometimes they lead us back to emotions and feelings we have in common," he wrote.

Of course, to succeed, we must conscript all of our friends and family in this storytelling experiment. Because, as Burns explains, "it is the diversity of our experiences that creates something new and better, something even more American."

(CNN) It was a powerful television moment: the ex-US ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, listening to a snippet from a rough transcript of President Donald Trump -- the man who ousted her -- predicting to a foreign leader, "She's going to go through some things."

"It sounded like a threat," Yovanovitch testified during her public hearing before the House Intelligence Committee Friday.

Then to top it, Committee Chairman Rep. Adam Schiff read aloud a fresh Trump attack on Yovanovitch, tweeted in the midst of her testimony: "Everywhere Marie Yovanovitch went turned bad," Trump wrote. "She started off in Somalia, how did that go?..."

Asked about the tweet, the veteran ambassador, who worked for 33 years in the State Department, responded, "It's very intimidating."

"Let's be clear: his tweet was terrible," Republican strategistwrote. " It was also nonsensical. To blame Ambassador Yovanovich for the 1990s troubles in Somalia, where she served as a foreign service officer, not ambassador, is so preposterous it can be dismissed out of hand."

Frida Ghitis summed up Yovanovich's role: " summed up Yovanovich's role: " An American hero, attacked by an American president ; removed from her post not because she failed to do her job but because she was doing it too well. As a result of Trump's actions, American policy went from supporting anti-corruption efforts to combating them. And for whose benefit?"

Friday's hearing, which took place as Trump ally Roger Stone was being convicted in a Washington courthouse of lying to Congress, capped the first week of public sessions on the House Democrats' impeachment inquiry.

On Wednesday, Bill Taylor, who now serves as America's leading diplomat in Ukraine, described what he called a "highly irregular" Ukraine policy channel operating in parallel to the traditional State Department structure. It was led by Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani and included US Ambassador to the EU Gordon Sondland, special envoy Kurt Volker and Energy Secretary Rick Perry -- referred to by Schiff as "The Three Amigos."

Joe Lockhart wrote, "It's almost impossible to dispute that there was a deal on the table that would wrote, "It's almost impossible to dispute that there was a deal on the table that would trade the release of aid to Ukraine for Ukrainian investigations that would help Trump win the next election."

Not that outlandish

Republicans offered a variety of defenses for Trump, but the rhetorical height came when GOP counsel Steve Castor asked Taylor, "In fairness, this irregular channel of diplomacy, it's not as outlandish as it could be. Is that correct?"

Paul Begala wrote that none of the Republican defenses made sense.

"What we heard -- and saw -- was the death of the Republican Party's commitment to truth, principle, dignity and the Constitution," Begala argued.

Scott Jennings argued that Trump deserves credit for the lethal military aid now being provided to Ukraine, a step that President Barack Obama resisted. " argued that Trump deserves credit for the lethal military aid now being provided to Ukraine, a step that President Barack Obama resisted. " Democrats want to toss out an American president for a brief delay in military aid to Ukraine under Trump, who is actually providing the Ukrainians with lethal aid -- including sniper rifles, rocket launchers and Javelin anti-tank missiles -- to combat the Russians."

Asha Rangappa wrote, "This, of course, only underscores the necessity of having former National Security Advisor John Bolton and Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney -- both of whom who have firsthand knowledge of Trump's intentions towards Ukraine -- testify. Trump, however, has Republicans made much of the fact that none of the first three witnesses had any direct contact with Trump.wrote, "This, of course, only underscores the necessity of having former National Security Advisor John Bolton and Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney -- both of whom who have firsthand knowledge of Trump's intentions towards Ukraine -- testify. Trump, however, has blocked both from providing testimony , undercutting Republicans' implication that their testimony would exonerate the President."

Another line of defense from right-leaning media outlets, after Wednesday's first hearing with Taylor and a top State Department official overseeing Ukraine, George Kent, was that the hearing was "boring" and wouldn't engage ordinary Americans' interest. The argument did not surprise Nicole Hemmer: "Fox News, which for the past three years has been working as a propaganda arm of the administration has to find a way to undermine the evidence that the hearings will expose the American people to in the coming days."

Other takes on impeachment:

Julian Zelizer: Forget about the predicted backlash against Democrats

Michael D'Antonio: Trump is a victim of his own impulses

Aaron David Miller and Richard Sokolsky: Marie Yovanovitch got smeared. Where was Mike Pompeo?

What divides us

In Utah, a man skipped his stepdaughter's wedding. In Boston, a Trump supporter is afraid to wear his MAGA hat. In the Tampa area, an independent put a "no politics" sign on his office door to warn co-workers. In North Carolina, a Republican concludes, "Political debate right now is a blood sport."

For the last six months, CNN Opinion's Yaffa Fredrick has led a team exploring the "Fractured States of America."

Their special report will continue for the next two weeks. Fredrick found, "In 2019, there's only one thing that unites us: just how divided we think we are. In fact, according to the Public Religion Research Institute, 91% of Americans feel we are polarized -- and 74% feel we are extremely polarized."

Division is producing stress, raising fears of violence and poisoning politics.

Among them:of Las Vegas, who wrote, "I have purposely stayed off of social media because I was starting to hate people that I have loved for years ...It's sad how far each side has gone to the left and right.

The fate of Venice

David Perry, who has lived in Venice and written about it as a historian, shared the widespread concern over its fate as flooding reached historic levels. "From its founding in the Early Middle Ages, Venice has had a fraught relationship with the sea, dependent on it for food and trade, protected from the mainland by the waters of the lagoon, yet always threatened by changing environmental conditions. , who has lived in Venice and written about it as a historian, shared the widespread concern over its fate as flooding reached historic levels. "From its founding in the Early Middle Ages, Venice has had a fraught relationship with the sea, dependent on it for food and trade, protected from the mainland by the waters of the lagoon, yet always threatened by changing environmental conditions. Today, though, wind and water lash the palaces and churches with alarming frequency ," Perry wrote.

The sole hope, he noted, is that the risk of losing its cultural treasures will prompt world leaders to get serious about fighting climate change and the accompanying rise in sea levels. "Could the rising waters that imperil Venice prompt some sort of shift in mentality in those who have the power to help?"

Join the crowd

Just when the field of candidates running for president as Democrats was starting to shrink, two new ones jumped in: Michael Bloomberg and Deval Patrick. And Hillary Clinton said that she was under "enormous" pressure to join them (although so far, she hasn't announced any plans to do so).

SE Cupp suggested that Clinton should stay out. " suggested that Clinton should stay out. " The process is working just fine, despite the anxieties of Democratic donors who believe a late entrant like Hillary Clinton or Michael Bloomberg is needed to save Democratic voters from themselves. But Clinton, especially, isn't the answer."

Looking in-depth at the results of the election this month, former Rep. Charlie Dent, examined the implosion of support for his fellow Republicans in the suburbs of his home state. "The lesson learned from Pennsylvania, which went for Donald Trump in 2016, is the same as for the rest of the country," wrote Dent, a Republican. "As a result of his election and performance in office, the suburbs are nearly completely gone for the Republican Party."

The college crunch

Private colleges are reckoning with a coming demographic disaster: a shrinking student pool that may accelerate the closing and restructuring of campuses.

Steven L. Isenberg and John MacIntosh wrote, "any competitive industry with over-capacity, fixed assets (for example, campuses) and semi-fixed costs (such as staff) quickly faces hard choices and difficult finances. In an attempt to attract the shrinking pool of students, colleges are already cutting prices, spending more on enrollment strategies, investing in new facilities and chasing 'in demand' programs (for example, coding). While these decisions may be rational for individual schools, they are not collectively sustainable."

They urged college leaders to be realistic and to plan for disruptive change, easing the burden on students. " There is still time for at-risk colleges to transform themselves , rather than wait to hit the wall or be preemptively shut down by skittish regulators."

What saves this season of 'The Crown'

Olivia Colman and Tobias Menzies in 'The Crown'

In real life, Queen Elizabeth has never countenanced the idea of stepping down from her throne in favor of Prince Charles. But in the world of entertainment, Claire Foy has handed the role of the queen over to Olivia Colman, for the new season of "The Crown."

And Colman's performance in the Netflix series is "luminous," wrote Kate Maltby. "If there's a touch here of some of her previous characters, it's in her characteristic trick of letting human bitterness, venality or self-pity slip through her teeth for a half-second, every once in a while, before decency, politeness and a desperate, lonely desire to be liked shutter back down over her surface."

The rest of the cast is strong, noted Maltby, who found some issues with the scripts, though she admired this line delivered by the fictional queen: "Doing nothing is exactly what we do. And bide our time." <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) The Joker told Batman, "This is what happens when an unstoppable force meets an immovable object."

That line, from the closing minutes of "The Dark Knight", is one way to anticipate what will happen on Capitol Hill next week: Public hearings in the impeachment inquiry into President Donald Trump begin Wednesday.

The unstoppable force? A parade of witnesses testifying that Trump's White House appeared to be shaking down Ukraine's president to force an investigation of former vice president Joe Biden and his son Hunter, despite a lack of evidence of wrongdoing.

The immovable object: Trump and his GOP supporters, who this week tried out an array of defenses, including Sen. Lindsey Graham saying he won't read the witnesses' transcripts and that the process is "BS."

"As the President faces an impeachment inquiry, he, like any individual facing a serious allegation, has a right to mount a robust defense," noted Elliot Williams. "However, President Trump's behavior toward those tasked with congressional oversight and investigations into his personal conduct, and his attitude toward the current congressional impeachment inquiry are all rooted in the same idea: that our country's basic systems themselves are illegitimate."

Trump is relying on "public mistrust of government" and showing he doesn't understand the limits on presidential power, Williams wrote.

The problem for Democrats is that Trump's approach may be working, wrote Susan Glasser in the New Yorker.

"The allegations of abuse of power are striking and unprecedented: a President seeking to privatize American foreign policy for his personal political benefit." But we know how this will end, she suggested. "For Trump and his defenders, it is a coup, a show trial, a witch hunt. When that is the starting point, there is no place for the facts, no process that can satisfy, no way to split the difference... the President has successfully rendered the investigation irrelevant, at least for his most fervent supporters."

Fighting to sway the public

The open hearings may shift opinion. So far, polls show a huge partisan divide between an overwhelming majority of Democrats who favor impeachment and an equally solid bloc of Republicans who don't.

Arick Wierson argued that Democrats should drop the "quid pro quo" talk when describing Trump's interaction with Ukraine's president: "Americans are never going to agree to removing a President from office for engaging in acts argued that Democrats should drop the "quid pro quo" talk when describing Trump's interaction with Ukraine's president: "Americans are never going to agree to removing a President from office for engaging in acts described by a Latin term many don't understand or at least would never use ." Instead, "rebrand Trump's alleged transgressions with a term that most Americans don't need to Google to understand -- one with teeth. Bribery. Extortion. Payola. Shakedown. Ransom payment. There are plenty of better ways to say it than quid pro quo."

Elie Honig, who called the "relentless assault" by the President and his backers "wrong, irrelevant and dangerous." Witnesses have backed up all of the whistleblower's key allegations. All week Trump hammered away at the whistleblower , wrote, who called the "relentless assault" by the President and his backers "wrong, irrelevant and dangerous." Witnesses have backed up all of the whistleblower's key allegations.

Michael D'Antonio suggested that the vice president might not be an immovable object. "If Trump needs to find a scapegoat to take the heat off himself in the Ukraine scandal, Meanwhile the impeachment controversy dragged in Vice President Mike Pence, who met with Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky before military aid to that nation was released. Trump (and Pence) biographersuggested that the vice president might not be an immovable object. "If Trump needs to find a scapegoat to take the heat off himself in the Ukraine scandal, Pence is the perfect target ," he wrote.

OK Boomer, OK Millennial

In the New Zealand parliament, Chlöe Swarbrick's response when an older colleague heckled her during a climate crisis speech was instant: "OK Boomer." And it went viral.

So my colleague Pat Wiedenkeller asked two of CNN Opinion's regular commentators to hash it out. Millennial Jill Filipovic wrote to Boomer Paul Callan: "You Boomers have called us 'snowflakes,' mocked us for trigger warnings and safe spaces (which are just an attempt to be sensitive to others), and even derided avocado toast (which is delicious). You were born into post-war prosperity, enjoyed the riches of government hand-outs and affordable education, then moved into your subsidized suburban homes and pulled the ladder up behind you."

Callan fired back: "Your professional success is undoubtedly the result of your Boomer parents raising you in a 'subsidized suburban home,' thereby facilitating the 'affordable education' you now criticize. The participation trophies were a Boomer error I readily admit."

Leymah Gbowee and José Ramos-Horta wrote, "Unencumbered by bureaucracy, conformity and conventional wisdom, In a related vein, two former Nobel Peace Prize winners, congratulated young activists for acting on climate issues while adults have largely abdicated.andwrote, "Unencumbered by bureaucracy, conformity and conventional wisdom, young people have the raw, out-of-the-box thinking that could lead to the development of the 'moonshot' ideas we need to save the planet."

2020 countdown

Everything in politics may look different less than a year from now, when voters choose a president. Tuesday's off-year election offered some intriguing clues.

Julian Zelizer described key results as " described key results as " extraordinarily frightening for Republicans . Like the 2018 House midterms, which were devastating to the GOP, the results in Kentucky and Virginia offer evidence that the president's record is putting their party in real jeopardy. They show that the President's imprint on politics -- more than almost anything else -- has the capacity to drive up Democratic turnout as the party's loyalists, including union members, show they are furious about what has taken place."

Alice Stewart was in accord with fellow Republicans who argued that their loss of the governorship in very red Kentucky wasn't Trump's fault. But she urged the Trump campaign to pay attention: was in accord with fellow Republicans who argued that their loss of the governorship in very red Kentucky wasn't Trump's fault. But she urged the Trump campaign to pay attention: "Suburbs are the new Florida, so focus on suburbia."

Ron Brownstein, noted that the GOP " In the Atlantic,, noted that the GOP " suffered resounding repudiations in urban centers and inner suburbs , which contain many of the nonwhite, young-adult, and white-collar white voters who polls show are most resistant to Trump." If the trend continues, it's hard to see how the President could again go down the narrow path that brought him victory in 2016.

There's alarm on the Democratic side too as the battle between two of the top tier candidates, Joe Biden and Elizabeth Warren, grew more fiery, particularly after Warren rolled out a Medicare for All plan that wipes out private health insurance.

Donald Trump, sports fan

President Trump has discovered his inner sports fan, leaving his resorts and the White House in recent weeks for a World Series game, a UFC fight and the LSU-Alabama game. In Alabama, he was cheered. But at the first two events he heard a sound that is never directed at him at his rallies: boos.

Dean Obeidallah: "Given polls showing nearly 60% of Americans disapprove of the job Trump is doing, It's what he deserves, wrote: "Given polls showing nearly 60% of Americans disapprove of the job Trump is doing, he should brace himself to hear a lot more boos between now and when he finally vacates the White House."

Politics and sports often don't mix. When the World Champion Washington Nationals visited the White House Monday, some team members didn't show up, including relief pitcher Sean Doolittle, who has objected to Trump's rhetoric. But some were enthusiastic, including catcher Kurt Suzuki who wore a MAGA hat for the occasion.

Paul Begala: "When liberal Sean Doolittle pitches, MAGA-loving Kurt Suzuki catches him...when they step inside those white lines to earn their living playing a kids' game, Suzuki and Doolittle have to put aside whatever political differences they may have and work together in perfect harmony for the good of the team. It took guts for both players, wrote: "When liberal Sean Doolittle pitches, MAGA-loving Kurt Suzuki catches him...when they step inside those white lines to earn their living playing a kids' game, Suzuki and Doolittle have to put aside whatever political differences they may have and work together in perfect harmony for the good of the team. I think a lot of politicians could learn from these two ballplayers ."

A special day

A century ago, on November 11, 1919, Americans marked the one-year anniversary of the end of World War I with a new holiday.

"Armistice Day" is now known as Veterans Day and it honors those who have served in the military in war and peace. Among those we should remember Monday, wrote Admiral Mike Gilday, the US Navy's Chief of Naval Operations is Cmdr. Ernest Evans, "who chose to sail the USS Johnston into harm's way during the Battle of Leyte Gulf in the Philippine Sea in 1944. Despite the superior Japanese force of battleships, heavy cruisers, and destroyers, Johnston's actions ultimately crippled the Imperial Japanese Navy. Evans, who died in action, was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor."

The lesson to remember? Gilday wrote, "Across the nation this Veterans Day, we honor the service, sacrifice and commitment of those men and women who have worn the cloth of this great nation. If you believe as I do that there is a desire in every human heart to live in freedom, then this day is a special day ."

Emma Watson looked shame in the face and won

Emma Watson, famous for playing Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter movies, spoke out about the pressures she deals with as her 30th birthday approaches. "It took me a long time, but I'm very happy (being single)," she said in an interview with Vogue. "I call it being self-partnered." The phrase drew some jeers on social media, but Holly Thomas wrote that there's nothing wrong with Watson's mindset and she didn't deserve "a maelstrom of criticism for her honesty."

The larger question, according to Thomas: "why does the pressure for women to partner up remain so rife? There is little evidence that, for them, being in a couple is necessarily better than being single in terms of life expectancy, happiness or health." <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) "My parents didn't want to move to Florida," Jerry Seinfeld used to say in his standup routines, "but they're in their sixties, and that's the law."

The joke resonated with audiences in New York, where there has been a decades-long migration of older residents to the Sunshine State in search of warmer weather and lower taxes. Now, at 73, President Donald Trump is going too.

Trump's legal change of residence from New York to Florida was reported by the New York Times Thursday. Trump's move may well reduce his tax liability but reporting on his tax returns has suggested he has been very successful at avoiding them even while living in a high-tax state.

"Trump's legal move to Florida may indeed be about taxes, as Trump himself suggests, but just not about paying taxes, which Trump doesn't do. Instead, the move seems inspired by attempts to disclose Trump's taxes , which the President also very much does not like to do," observed

"New York has been aggressive on the front of trying to shed light on Trump's taxes: The state legislature passed a law facilitating Congress's access to Trump's state-level returns, and the Manhattan district attorney, Cy Vance, has been pressing the case for access to Trump's returns in court." But Florida's Republican state officials will likely take a different stance, McCaffery noted. "In Florida, Trump can work on his tan while not worrying about any tax forms being disclosed to anyone."

Errol Louis wrote, "We may not know Trump's precise Florida-vs-New York tax math, wrote, "We may not know Trump's precise Florida-vs-New York tax math, but the political math behind relocating is crystal clear ...Trump clearly hopes to carry Florida's 29 electoral votes again to win re-election -- he kicked off his 2020 campaign with a rally in Orlando -- but he knows that it's still a true swing state, going to Republican President George Bush twice (in 2000 and 2004), then swinging back to Democratic President Barack Obama (in 2008 and 2012)."

The move has the added benefit for Trump of distance from a state and city whose politicians are particularly opposed to the President. Gov. Andrew Cuomo has been a fierce critic, Rep. Jerry Nadler heads up the House Judiciary Committee, which is part of the impeachment process, and Chuck Schumer leads the Democrats in the US Senate.

Impeachment game on

As the House voted to officially launch an impeachment inquiry, the divide between liberal and conservative commentators last week could not have been any starker.

Joe Lockhart, a Democrat who served in the White House during the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, credited House Speaker Nancy Pelosi with a smart strategy and suggested that upcoming public hearings on impeachment are likely to be persuasive: "By having staff counsel lead the questioning, Democrats have a very good chance of methodically telling the story of why the President should be impeached." By contrast, he wrote, " , a Democrat who served in the White House during the impeachment of President Bill Clinton, credited House Speaker Nancy Pelosi with a smart strategy and suggested that upcoming public hearings on impeachment are likely to be persuasive: "By having staff counsel lead the questioning, Democrats have a very good chance of methodically telling the story of why the President should be impeached." By contrast, he wrote, " The White House does not appear to have a strategy at all . The President has tweeted his way through the last few weeks looking desperate and angry, flitting from one defense to another." He gave Pelosi and the Democrats an A, House Republicans a B minus and Trump an F on strategy.

Republican Scott Jennings completely disagreed. The House will impeach and the Senate won't remove Trump, he predicted. "There will be nothing to show for it but wasted time and a diversion of the nation's political conversation away from issues that real people care about," he lamented.

All in the family

Michael D'Antonio, they "also remind us that the Impeachment became a family affair last week. Ivanka Trump quoted a letter Thomas Jefferson wrote to his daughter in 1801 bemoaning "enemies and spies catching and perverting" his statements. Ivanka Trump's husband, Jared Kushner, said in an interview that he has been busy cleaning up "messes" left behind by former vice president Joe Biden. While Kushner's comments to an Israeli TV station likely pleased his father-in-law, wrote, they "also remind us that the stickiest aspect of the impeachment crisis involves Biden in a way that reflects very negatively on the Trump side ."

Of course, family is at the heart of the impeachment inquiry, which focuses on the allegation that President Trump withheld aid to Ukraine while pressing that nation's new president to investigate Biden's son, Hunter. (No evidence of wrongdoing has surfaced against Joe and Hunter Biden.)

Danielle Brian, executive director of the Project On Government Oversight, argued that there's more than a little hypocrisy in Trump's focus on Hunter Biden. She wrote: "It is difficult to comprehend how Hunter Biden's activity is different from the ways in which Trump's own children are enriching themselves, with the one big exception: Trump's daughter and son-in-law are simultaneously acting in a governmental capacity... , executive director of the Project On Government Oversight, argued that there's more than a little hypocrisy in Trump's focus on Hunter Biden.

Trump is an utterly absurd messenger for this issue ."

The end for ISIS leader

On Sunday morning, President Trump made the announcement: ISIS leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi had died during a raid carried out by US special forces. Trump deserved to take a "victory lap," wrote Peter Bergen. "Trump's campaign against ISIS is one of the unalloyed foreign policy successes of his presidency," noted Bergen, adding that Trump and former president Obama had taken many of the same approaches to targeting terrorist groups and their leaders.

But ISIS is not dead, he wrote, and "as we saw with the death of Osama bin Laden eight years ago, the ideology of jihadism is not extinguished with the death of any one leader ."

Hero and the smear

Jill Filipovic. " Lt. Col. Alexander Vindman, who serves in the White House on the National Security Council staff, emerged as a key witness in the impeachment inquiry. While his decision to speak out was applauded by Democrats, Vindman was criticized by some pundits on the right, who suggested the Purple Heart-winning soldier's loyalty might be in question because of his roots in Ukraine. "The slanderous suggestions that he's disloyal because of birthplace and because he speaks Ukrainian are plainly disgusting," wrote. " And they are profoundly unpatriotic ."

Retired Lt. Gen. Mark Hertling recalled a conversation he had with another immigrant soldier who was working in a role similar to one Vindman once had. "She reminded me that of all the countries the US had as partners or were allied with as part of NATO, only one took an oath to defend a piece of paper...the Constitution. That's what makes us different, she said, because we don't vow to defend land or the head of state, we vow to protect and defend ideas."

Zuckerberg's contradiction

Twitter's CEO made Facebook's plight look even worse last week. Jack Dorsey announced that Twitter would no longer accept political advertising in the midst of a raging controversy over Facebook's decision to run political ads even if they're false.

Stanley Fish wrote that Twitter's move increased the pressure on Facebook's chief, Mark Zuckerberg, who has been visibly struggling to explain the company's stance, most notably in an exchange with Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez.

Zuckerberg last week defended the policy on a call with Wall Street analysts after the company reported blockbuster revenue and traffic.

"He is pledged to two contradictory ambitions," Fish wrote. "On the one hand, he doesn't want to censor anyone's speech, but on the other he doesn't want his platform to be the vehicle of evil effects." <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Editor’s note: Rosem Morton is a photographer and nurse based in Baltimore. The views expressed here are hers. Read more opinion on CNN.

After I was raped, the days felt never ending. It felt like I was clawing myself out of a deep pit, choking, starving, dying. I couldn’t sleep. I couldn’t eat. I couldn’t work. I was existing in a space where panic attacks were frequent and unpredictable. Where is safety? What is safe? I was overwhelmed and terrified. The feeling was too much and I needed to take the edge off. In trying to make sense of my experience, I picked up my camera and started shooting.

I photographed everything from what I was seeing to what was happening to how I was feeling. I felt like every survivor out there. If there was not enough proof, it did not happen. I kept photographing my proof. The proof of my struggle, of my survival. I learned to process through the lens of a camera. The work transformed itself to an expression of my silenced sorrows and pain.

I spent a lot of time behind closed doors and I started to notice the comings and goings of light. Raising my hand to meet the sun, I remind myself that I am still surviving.

When I told my husband I was assaulted, I said, "I will go to therapy for a couple of months and put all of this behind me." By November, I had been seeing my therapist every week for four months. At the end of this session, I broke down in my car and realized the work has only just begun.

“You are safe. You are safe. You are safe.” This was my mantra to calm myself down.

According to the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network (RAINN), an American is sexually assaulted every 92 seconds. One out of six American women has been a victim of attempted or completed rape. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention links the trauma of sexual violence with a myriad of short- and long-term consequences, including chronic health problems, diminished ability to work and perhaps worst of all, an increased risk of further sexual or intimate partner violence.

These statistics are alarming, yet a year ago I did not give it much thought. I naively believed that if I followed what I was taught — to avoid dark alleys, to avoid dressing too provocatively and to be wary of strangers — I would be above the fray. Instead, aside from shattering my misconceptions, every part of me was shattered by my assault.

In October, I received a phone call from my assaulter. It was not an admission of fault or an apology. It was a phone call to tell me how he felt his actions were justified. The phone call was so devastating that I crashed my car into the garage and broke my side mirror. A few days later, I looked at myself in broken pieces.

On a torn piece of paper, I wrote down the details of my assault for my husband to read “when you are ready.”

This photo, taken in February, was the first time since the assault that I traveled alone to a place where I knew no one.

I kept moving away and saying “no, no, no.” He did not stop. I remember shaking uncontrollably on that warm summer day. It felt like a void consumed me from the inside out. I was left with nothing. I became nothing.

But I don’t want to focus on the details of my assault. For me, the focus is on the aftermath.

I left my assaulter in a daze and walked an hour home. I told my best friend who did not believe or understand me. We had followed everything we were taught to do. How could it happen? It could and it did. I called my husband and he asked me if I reported it. I didn’t. I froze. It’s funny how our body tricks us in order to help us to survive. At that moment, it felt like a day ago when it really was just hours. It felt too late. I felt too late to matter.

A letter from my husband, Ian, reads: “I knew you were strong but now I can see how truly strong you are. You have been challenged more than anyone should have to endure, but I can see the determination and strength in you that will get you through it all. I knew you were special, but now I know just how amazing you are. I can never explain to you how wonderful you are, or how much you mean to me, or the extent to which you have helped me grow. But please know you are the most amazing person I have ever known. Please know I love you for all you are.” My dogs, Maia and Akira, sense the changes. They come one after another, licking and encouraging me to go on.

“Your touch grounds me.” Ian and I tangle our legs closer and closer. These are snippets of my past life, torn down and ready to be rebuilt.

Within a week, I was fortunate enough to find some help. My gynecologist, from whom I sought treatment after the attack, recognized I was in crisis and helped me find the right therapist. I decided to tell more of my friends to garner more support. Instead, I felt more blame and shame.

As I told more people, I endured unsupportive responses. Engaging so early had its cost. It felt like I was bleeding myself dry. I thought I really needed them to believe and support me. All I really needed was to believe and support myself. It was not and is not my fault.

With some of my friends, it seemed like it was easy to ask how I was doing and then easier to ignore me if I gave an honest and uncomfortable answer. The truth is no one is prepared for trauma because no one talks about trauma.

A 20-hour flight is a long time to be in your own head. I am restless and anxious, so I pick up my phone to photograph instead.

The anxiety starts from the core and tries to find its way out.

Later on, I decided to report the rape. People offered their own opinions, most of which were discouraging. They said my life would get turned upside down for a man who would get away with it. They warned me about what court would be like — but not about the trauma of the reporting process. When I told the police officer I was reporting a rape, she took me outside the building and made me state my case in public. She interrupted me and said she could not take my statement.

It was devastating to ask someone to do their job to serve and protect, but it was soul-crushing to have to beg a woman to believe another woman. I spoke to many officers afterward who told me this case was not worth their time. I realize now some of the many reasons why according to 2016 Justice Department numbers, nearly 80% of rapes and sexual assaults go unreported, and RAINN reports that out of 1,000 assaulters, 995 of them will walk free. Too often our culture socializes us to do the easier thing rather than the right thing.

I have always loved wildflowers; I admire their ability to bloom and thrive. In a high-stress job, I fear that the trauma and the stress would collide. How then can I care for my patients?

I started eating a warm bowl of oatmeal every morning. It helps me feel something besides coldness inside. I spent my birthday in March driving back and forth in the pouring rain of Baltimore.

Still, I found another police officer for my statement. I told my story but never heard back about any investigation or followup. Although it hurts, I tell myself I still stood up for myself. Sometimes, it helps. For the most part, photography has helped. It has bridged the gap by allowing my voice I thought was forever silenced to be heard. Over time, I discovered what I ultimately crave. I crave a connection to myself that I lost.

As I complete this photo project, I am learning that rape is not just an assault of the mind and body but also of the voice. I always think about how my life could have been different if had I known back then a story like what ended up happening to me. Maybe when I was raped when I was 18, I would have understood what happened to me. I might have gotten help. Maybe, when I was 27, I wouldn’t have been raped. Maybe it wouldn’t have taken that rape to get me into therapy, where I would begin to make sense of the traumas in my life.

I saw my gynecologist for a follow-up visit. He asked how I was doing and really looked at me. I learned that people are rooting for me.

I am relearning my body and what it means to be intimate again.

I told myself I will get wildflowers tattooed on me one day as a testament to what I have endured.

My husband sometimes asks me: Why are you sharing this work now, so early in your experience? Why can’t it wait? I always answer: Because it is important. It feels necessary. Although this turbulent journey is far from over, I am compelled to speak up and share my story. The world may be determined to silence us, but I am even more determined to speak up and share my story. My project is dedicated to the innocent girl I was and to many others who think they are alone. You’re not. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) By the time you reach your 30s, you think you know yourself -- your likes, your dislikes, what inspires you, what makes you tick.

But there I was, at 36 years old, realizing I didn't know myself at all.

I had everything I thought made my life perfect. I was married to my best friend and we had two beautiful, healthy and hilarious children, with successful careers and a beautiful home.

My life would change forever after a simple Google search in November 2016. I had just seen Kate McKinnon perform the song "Hallelujah" on SNL and discovered that she's a lesbian. That shocked me because she didn't fit the awful stereotype often depicted in the media.

I quickly declared her my "new girl crush." But it was more than that.

At that moment, I realized that I wanted a relationship with a woman like her -- but I felt terrible for even having this thought, as someone who was faithfully married.

It was slowly becoming clear to me that I was not straight.

How could I not know? I had my first "boyfriend" in the 3rd grade. I had already decided I was straight. How do you go back on that after being with guys for 20+ years?

Where I fell on the sexuality spectrum would take me the better part of two years to figure out. A part of myself wasn't living. And by not letting that part live, I was slowly dying.

Unraveling a life

There's a price of admission for coming out as gay later in life. Over the course of several months, I paid the price daily. It was like I was watching a movie about myself but unable to control what was unfolding. Everything fell apart.

I did my best to slowly confide in my husband. But I kept many of my feelings inside to avoid hurting him. He tried to be supportive, but he also needed answers.

He felt unsettled and scared about the uncertainty of our future. He asked several times if I was a lesbian. It was a question that felt impossible to answer because I knew what that answer would mean.

I kept waiting for the moment where I would realize I was no longer gay so I could put a halt to everything. My family was being shattered and I couldn't stop it. I constantly had to remind myself, "You get one life. This is your life and no one else's."

I felt alone. I was crumbling and desperately looking for someone who could relate. I Googled to the ends of the earth looking for stories like mine. They were few and far between -- and none seemed to touch on just how difficult the journey ahead of me could be.

By early 2018, my husband and I separated in an effort to give me some perspective. I lost time with my children as we began a shared custody schedule. I was consumed by the pit in my stomach -- the shame of ending my marriage because I was gay was like lugging a sandbag over my shoulders and having a rock in my stomach at the same time. I couldn't eat. My weight dropped by the day. For the first time since I met my husband, we went a full day without speaking.

I wasn't sure how to tell my conservative, Georgia-born and bred parents that their former pageant queen daughter was ending her marriage because she is gay. I'm very close with my parents -- a phone call with my mom is almost a daily occurrence.

I confided in my sister first. I wasn't brave enough to actually say the words -- the label of being gay or a lesbian was too much for my soul to bear at the time -- so I sent her a text message, "I am not straight."

She responded perfectly, asking if she could buy a Pride flag and offered to tell my parents.

Later that day, I got two of the most relieving texts from my parents that I've ever received.

I didn't realize until then how important it was to be accepted by my parents. I'm a grown woman, fully independent of my mom and dad -- but I still needed their love and acceptance.

Living my truth

Telling my family wasn't the end of my journey. I was finally figuring out who I was. Now I was ashamed by that answer.

That began to subside when I met other women in various stages of the coming out process, all on the same path. Hearing the experience of others felt like hearing my own: married to wonderful men, mothers of amazing kids, the perfect life practically every woman strives for.

Through this group, led by a therapist, we quickly determined we are in this together. We were on a path that feels impossible to navigate until one day, you can live your truth and be perfectly fine shaping a new life.

That's what I'm striving to do now: shape a new life that includes my now ex-husband and my kids. Our family structure just looks a little different than it used to. We spend most holidays together, attend parent-teacher conferences, we even have plans to take the kids to Disney World in the fall.

We no longer have the perfect suburban home together, but we are both navigating new relationships and have found people who understand the importance of us both being present for our children.

On New Year's Day this year, I came out on social media. I expected to see my friend list tick down but instead I was met by love and support. So many people choose to keep their private lives private, which I absolutely understand and respect.

But what so many don't realize is that sharing your tough moments can make other people's tough moments a little easier.

I don't think I would have been able to accept who I am as quickly as I did without the changes in American society in recent years. When I was growing up in the 1980s, someone's sexuality was only spoken about in hushed voices, as if the person had a disease they didn't want others to know about.

Democratic presidential candidate Pete Buttigieg -- who, like me, is in his late 30s and, like me, came out publicly just a few years ago -- put it this way : "It's hard to face the truth that there were times in my life when, if you had shown me exactly what it was inside me that made me gay, I would have cut it out with a knife. If you had offered me a pill to make me straight, I would've swallowed it before you had time to give me a sip of water."

There is so much truth in his statement. There was such a big part of me that did not want to be gay. I think you'd be hard-pressed to find a gay person over the age of 30 who hasn't felt this way.

On the flip side, it is getting better for younger generations. When I told my kids last year that if mom remarries, it will be to a woman -- it didn't faze them in the least.

Throughout all of this, I would have loved to have known that I was going to come out on the other side and be OK. And I want people reading my story to know that it's OK to be the person you're meant to be -- no matter what your age is when you finally get to know yourself and love who you are in the process. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Each December, we ask a group of CNN contributors and commentators for their predictions on some of the big events in the coming year. Some picks are expected, some surprising, and sometimes even our fearless prognosticators admit they have no idea what to pick! See whose prior predictions have come true.

2019 Which film will win the Oscar for best picture in 2019? “Green Book” won the Academy Award for Best Picture. SE Cupp CNN commentator I’ve seen close to no movies (I have a 3-year-old!), but I did get to see “First Man,” and it would certainly get my vote. Jill Filipovic CNN opinion contributor I'm going to bet on “A Star is Born,” even though “BlacKkKlansman” probably deserves it more. James Gagliano CNN law enforcement analyst It continues to rankle me that the stodgy, tradition-oriented Academy still relegates documentary films to their own separate category. But let’s hope there’s a break with tradition this year, and the wonderful documentary on Fred Rogers -- “Won’t You Be My Neighbor” -- wins. Frida Ghitis CNN opinion contributor Crowd-pleasing films such as “Black Panther” or “A Star is Born” could emerge victorious, even if they were not the best movies of the year. But the deserving winner will be “Roma,” a gripping black-and-white reminiscence about a turbulent time in Mexico and the life of a domestic worker. Joey Jackson CNN legal analyst My vote is for “A Star is Born” -- great chemistry between the two stars. And it was full of surprises -- Bradley Cooper, an actor who I thought could act, but not sing, turned out to be able to do both. And Lady Gaga, who I thought could sing, but not act, surprised me with her theatrical chops. Scott Jennings CNN contributor Final three for me are “BlacKkKlansman,” “A Star is Born” and “Black Panther.” While I think “A Star is Born” will win, I’m rooting for Spike Lee’s “BlacKkKlansman.” Roxanne Jones CNN opinion contributor So many great movies this year -- from Spike Lee’s “BlacKkKlansman,” Barry Jenkins’ adaption of the James Baldwin novel, “If Beale Street Could Talk,” and Marvel’s “Black Panther.” I’m going with “Beale Street” for the Oscar win. Confession: I never saw “A Star is Born” -- you can’t top Barbra Streisand and Kris Kristofferson in the 1976 version. Peniel Joseph CNN opinion contributor “Black Panther.” Hollywood makes a statement embracing a film that represented both a cultural movement and historical moment -- one that illustrated the power of film to achieve the universal through the story of black and African diasporic identities. Dean Obeidallah CNN opinion contributor “Black Panther” or “BlacKkKlansman,” neither of which Trump would ever watch. But I think the Spike Lee-directed film “BlacKkKlansman” takes home the statue. Jen Psaki CNN political commentator “A Star is Born.” Raul Reyes CNN opinion contributor Best picture will likely go to “A Star Is Born.” It has everything Academy voters love: a Hollywood storyline, A-list stars, a cinematic legacy and strong box-office performance. Timothy Stanley Historian In a sane world, Best Picture would go to “First Man,” a movie that looks big -- it’s about the Apollo moon mission -- but actually deals with something small and human, one man’s alienation from the world around him. It’s as close to poetry as Hollywood gets. Alice Stewart CNN political commentator My money is on “Black Panther” because it was a high-action blockbuster, and it delivers an important political message: With great power comes great responsibility. In addition, the movie breaks Hollywood barriers that should have been broken many years ago. Holly Thomas CNN opinion contributor Lady Gaga can regurgitate anecdotes until the cows come home, and I’d still be delighted if “A Star Is Born” won. But I suspect “Widows” will sneak round the back and win it. Jeff Yang CNN opinion contributor My heart yearns for Wakanda (“Black Panther”), but the Academy is likely going to go Lady Gaga (“A Star is Born”).

2019 The 2020 race: Which Democrat running for president will lead the polls of Democratic voters at the end of 2019? Which Republican will lead the polls of that party’s voters? SE Cupp CNN commentator Of the 300 people who will run, I imagine Beto O’Rourke will have the best chance of navigating the primary and cutting through with voters. On the other side, I can’t envision a convincing challenger to Trump will emerge (though one can dream). Jill Filipovic CNN opinion contributor I predict Bernie Sanders will lead the polls at the end of 2019, based primarily on name recognition. He will not be the nominee in 2020. And I feel fairly confident in predicting that Trump will be his party's nominee. James Gagliano CNN law enforcement analyst My early money leans toward Beto O’Rourke (who recently met with President Obama to discuss a 2020 run) as a 2019 frontrunner. And I don’t foresee any emergent Republican candidate that could contend with an unleashed, nothing-to-lose Donald Trump in the Republican primary. Frida Ghitis CNN opinion contributor With hordes of lawmakers, governors and businesspeople pondering a run, and Democrats energized for victory, the polls will confound the experts and baffle campaign managers. Familiar names -- Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders -- will lead early, driven largely by name recognition. Late in the year, the horserace will favor Senator Amy Klobuchar, who will lead the pack. On the GOP side, Trump will lead, but he will face a serious challenger. Joey Jackson CNN legal analyst I think Beto O’Rourke will lead the Democratic contenders -- he is inspiring, a visionary and also a man of the people. Meanwhile, Trump, the disruptive and divisive President, will lead the Republicans. Scott Jennings CNN contributor Beto O’Rourke will lead the Democratic pack, and Donald Trump will still lead the Republicans. Roxanne Jones CNN opinion contributor Republican voters will turn on Donald Trump and look to Vice President Mike Pence to run for president. Democrats, angry and eager to take back the Oval, won’t stray too far left from traditional names or politics. Joe Biden will be the guy most Democrats trust to lead and heal the nation -- but his only hope of winning in 2020 is to have a progressive woman, like Kamala Harris, as his running mate. Peniel Joseph CNN opinion contributor Beto O’Rourke will lead the Democrats, since he is the first Democratic candidate since Barack Obama to inspire a belief in civic ideals, social justice and the grand notion that America belongs to all of us. And Donald Trump will lead the Republicans, as he continues to play to his base of nationalists and populists. Jen Psaki CNN political commentator Beto O'Rourke will be ahead for the Democrats, and Donald Trump, assuming he is still in office (which isn’t a sure thing), will be ahead for Republicans. Raul Reyes CNN opinion contributor The Democrat’s frontrunner will be Joe Biden, while the Republican frontrunner will be Donald Trump. But this will be more about name recognition and familiarity than anything else; once the 2020 race is really underway, all bets are off. Timothy Stanley Historian Trump is obviously a shoe-in for the Republican nomination, but the Democratic field remains such a mess that I wouldn’t be surprised if the polls are dominated by a celebrity (Oprah), someone who won’t run (Joe Biden) or the eternal candidacy of Hillary Clinton. Biden, however, will be the most popular because he’s the most realistic populist liberal. Alice Stewart CNN political commentator I will be keeping my eyes on Texas Democrat Beto O’Rourke, who represents the young face that the Democrats want with the strong fundraising ability that they need. He ran a solid race for Senate in 2018, but his policies were too blue for Texas. President Trump has maintained high approval among his base, and I expect him to lead the GOP polls at the end of the year. Holly Thomas CNN opinion contributor In the UK, there is a popular Twitter phenomenon known as “the banter timeline.“ This is the notion that of all the possible courses our future might have taken, the one we are living is so patently ridiculous that the gods must have designed it purely for ”the banter.“ The banter timeline would dictate that the Democrat candidate leading by the end of 2019 would be Hillary Clinton. (Though she wouldn’t necessarily have the best odds of winning.) I suspect the Republicans will prefer to stick with the devil they know -- and choose Trump. Jeff Yang CNN opinion contributor The knives are already out on social media between the various factions of the Democratic Party, and history has shown us that undermining the future candidate (and the process that selects him or her) produces the worst of all possible outcomes. If pressed, I'll say Kamala Harris/Beto O'Rourke looks like our best bet for victory, but it'll depend on who President Pelosi decides to endorse. Either way, GOP frontrunner Mitt Romney will find a way to lose.

2019 Brexit: Will the UK leave the EU in 2019, and if it does, will it be with or without an agreed-upon deal? SE Cupp CNN commentator It’s the law, so I think it will happen regardless of a deal. Jill Filipovic CNN opinion contributor No, they won't leave this year -- they'll either delay and/or re-vote. James Gagliano CNN law enforcement analyst As I understand it, the “divorce” is now compulsory, with the exit date scheduled for March 29. To delay this -- or nullify it -- would require change to British law, along with an agreement from the rest of the EU. So, absent a change in law, I foresee the departure occurring with an agreed-upon final deal to be reached at a later date. Frida Ghitis CNN opinion contributor Prime Minister Theresa May’s efforts to implement a decision she opposes -- pulling the UK out of the European Union -- will fail. Her plan will be rejected and the option of leaving without a deal will seem so scary that Britain will hold a second referendum. After having voted so casually the first time around, frantically checking the implications after voting, Britons will vote to remain and Brexit will be over. Joey Jackson CNN legal analyst The UK will leave, with a deal: That’s what the masses want. And nobody does anything without a deal. Scott Jennings CNN contributor Yes, the UK will leave the EU and there will eventually be a deal struck -- messy as it seems now. Roxanne Jones CNN opinion contributor British Prime Minister Theresa May came to office after the Brexit vote and has been struggling ever since to get a deal that satisfies all parties. As European leaders stand firm on their terms for Brexit, it seems certain Great Britain will leave the EU in 2019 without a deal. Peniel Joseph CNN opinion contributor The UK will stay in the EU. Prime Minister Theresa May averts political disaster by allowing the nation to gracefully come to its senses regarding their place in the world. Dean Obeidallah CNN opinion contributor No deal. The government will collapse, and new elections will delay it all. Jen Psaki CNN political commentator The UK won’t leave without a deal because it will send the country and markets into chaos. But the deadline for a deal is fast approaching in March and one option would be for another referendum vote. Given the trends and demographics in the UK, a vote to stay in the EU is not out of the question. Raul Reyes CNN opinion contributor Yes, the UK will be leaving the EU on March 29, 2019, because it is the law, deal or no deal. With that deadline looming and little progress made so far on major issues like trade and customs, it seems likely -- and unfortunate -- that Britain will exit without a deal in place. Timothy Stanley Historian Right now, it looks like Britain either won’t leave the EU in 2019, or it will leave without a deal. Most likely, though, it will leave without a deal. Alice Stewart CNN political commentator The fact that British Prime Minister Theresa May won a vote of confidence by Conservative Party lawmakers indicates Brexit will happen. May has made it clear she is focused on delivering an orderly exit from the EU, and I expect that to happen. Holly Thomas CNN opinion contributor Answers to this change roughly every 12 hours, but I reckon, despite the daily option tombola, we'll leave the EU with the agreed deal in 2019. Jeff Yang CNN opinion contributor I predict the UK will leave the EU without a deal, followed by Northern Ireland, Scotland and the City of London leaving the UK.

2019 50 years after men first walked on the moon, what will be the year’s biggest space exploration story? SE Cupp CNN commentator Commercial space exploration happening next year -- both SpaceX and Boeing are looking to send NASA astronauts. I’m also available, guys! Jill Filipovic CNN opinion contributor Fingers crossed it's Jeff Bezos launching himself into space. James Gagliano CNN law enforcement analyst 2019 could be the year of the US Space Force, as Pentagon and Trump administration officials remain deeply engaged in discussions on the topic. If the Russians have had one on-and-off since the early 1990s, why can’t we? Frida Ghitis CNN opinion contributor Entrepreneurs Richard Branson and Jeff Bezos, racing to privatize space travel, will send their first tourists into orbit. That will become the top space story of the year. But for those of us who remain earthbound, nothing will beat the thrill of watching the International Space Station streaking gently across the sky. You can do what I do, sign up with NASA for alerts when the ISS flies over your house. Joey Jackson CNN legal analyst SpaceX and/or Boeing will launch NASA astronauts inside commercial space ships. Thereafter, it’ll become accessible to the masses (who have enough money to pay for seats). Scott Jennings CNN contributor Non-astronauts will fly into space -- albeit briefly -- on a commercially purchased ticket. Roxanne Jones CNN opinion contributor A human-led expedition to Mars, comprised of volunteer American citizens, scientists and others from across the globe – and funded by Elon Musk’s SpaceX project. Add my name to the list. This #Trekkie is ready to “seek out new life and new civilizations.” Peniel Joseph CNN opinion contributor In 2019, we will send an unmanned space probe to Mars -- bringing us one step closer to successfully landing astronauts on the red planet. Dean Obeidallah CNN opinion contributor We send NASA astronauts into Trump’s brain to figure out what is going on with him. There is clearly a great deal of space there to explore. Or, perhaps more realistically, commercial flights successfully head into space. Jen Psaki CNN political commentator We will learn a lot more about the climate on Mars, thanks to NASA. Raul Reyes CNN opinion contributor Space tourism -- the race between rich guys Jeff Bezos and Elon Musk to send paying passengers into outer space. Timothy Stanley Historian We’re still dreaming of going to Mars, but my hope for 2019 is that someone finally explores us: an alien who took the wrong turn around Venus. I’d like to hand them the keys to the planet and let them run it for a while, and if they occasionally eat us, it’ll still be an improvement on the current management. Alice Stewart CNN political commentator The most important space story for 2019 concerns progress being made to prioritize the national security issues related to space, in an effort to stay competitive with China and Russia. The establishment of the New Space Command is a step closer to President Trump's desired Space Force, which would ensure the safety of US spacecraft and astronauts in space. I support the idea of the Space Force, but believe it can be accomplished in the current structure of the US military. Holly Thomas CNN opinion contributor Chinese aircraft Chang’e-4 is due to land on the dark side of the moon. I think it's extraordinary that, despite the fact we've gone so much farther afield already, this will be the first time humans have explored the unseen side of our satellite. Jeff Yang CNN opinion contributor Elon Musk's orbital Tesla is going to make a first encounter with intelligent alien life.

2019 What will the Dow Jones end at in 2019? Jill Filipovic CNN opinion contributor It will be down 0.3%, a number I have selected for absolutely no reason. James Gagliano CNN law enforcement analyst Though my enthusiasm for tracking the market summary waned following the evaporation of the vast majority of my 401(k) on that darkest of days of 2008, I am going to predict we'll be somewhere around where we are right now, in the 24,000 range. Frida Ghitis CNN opinion contributor The stock market euphoria that greeted Donald Trump’s election, like many other illusions, is now over. The Dow was already rising nicely in 2016 and the optimism continued in 2017. The party has ended. In 2019, the market will fall in the first part of the year and start recovering in the latter part. Final Dow: 22,500. Joey Jackson CNN legal analyst 25,783 -- market remains strong, with ebbs and flows Scott Jennings CNN contributor Take your Dramamine® and delete your favorite stock ticker from your phone. A flat year is a win at 23,900. Roxanne Jones CNN opinion contributor Expect more dizzying ups and downs in early 2019, as the results of Trump’s trade wars, attacks on tech companies, and other policies unsettle investors. Then, the Dow will slow down considerably and level off around 26,000, as investors pull back and America braces for the 2020 presidential election. Peniel Joseph CNN opinion contributor 22,000. The President’s resumption of trade wars with China and other parts of the world keeps skittish investors on their toes. Dean Obeidallah CNN opinion contributor 26,342, so slightly better than it is today. Jen Psaki CNN political commentator With rising uncertainty in the global marketplace over China and a slowdown in growth, the Dow will go down next year to 23,000. Raul Reyes CNN opinion contributor Dow Jones will end around 21,000 in 2019, due to domestic political instability and growing economic uncertainty over Trump’s trade policies. Alice Stewart CNN political commentator When it comes to the Dow and polling, I follow trends and not daily snapshots. We are ending 2018 close to where we started in January, around 24,800, so I will say we will end 2019 in that rage, around 24,600. Holly Thomas CNN opinion contributor Much like the cult hero of “Legally Blonde,” Elle Woods, I suspect the DJ will “bend and snap.” That is to say: the hugely volatile political landscape internationally in 2019 and new trade arrangements will see everything vulnerable for a while, but it will settle roughly back where it started by Christmas -- hovering around 24,000. Jeff Yang CNN opinion contributor It'll depend on whether stock prices are being calculated in rubles or in renminbi, I guess. For now, closer to 15,000.

2019 What will be the Grammys’ Album of the Year? Country singer Kacey Musgraves took home the Grammy for her album, “Golden Hour.” SE Cupp CNN commentator Cardi B's "Invasion of Privacy." Jill Filipovic CNN opinion contributor It had damn well better be Janelle Monaé. James Gagliano CNN law enforcement analyst “Beerbongs and Bentleys” and “Dirty Computer” are really two of the nominees? Since no music from the 1970s was nominated, I guess the Grammy for Album of the Year goes to “Black Panther” -- only because I enjoyed the movie and because I don't recognize any of the other albums nominated. Frida Ghitis CNN opinion contributor The most striking feature of the Grammy awards will be the dominance of women, who will shine in most categories after last year’s embarrassment. The winner will be the unpretentiously likeable folk singer-songwriter Brandi Carlile, nominated for six Grammys. Best album: “By the Way, I Forgive You.” Joey Jackson CNN legal analyst Cardi B: “Invasion of Privacy.” She’s a rising star who is authentic, fresh, new and raw. Scott Jennings CNN contributor Unless it is on “Kids Place Live” on SiriusXM, I probably haven’t heard it. I will go with “Scorpion” by Drake. Roxanne Jones CNN opinion contributor Cardi B’s “Invasion of Privacy” wins Album of the Year because I love imperfect, confident, self-made women. And as a child of the original hip-hop generation, I always want this beautiful, unapologetically black musical genre to win on the big stage. Peniel Joseph CNN opinion contributor The “Black Panther” album will win. A cultural milestone that dominated 2018 reaps full rewards and recognition across multiple platforms, led by the Pulitzer Prize-winning icon Kendrick Lamar. Dean Obeidallah CNN opinion contributor I’ll go with Drake’s album. Jen Psaki CNN political commentator Cardi B. It is the year of the rapper with a huge number of nominations, and whether you like her or not, she is the most talked-about and fascinating musical artist this year. Raul Reyes CNN opinion contributor The Grammys have not always been inclusive when it comes to women and hip-hop artists. 2019 will be different when Cardi B wins best Album for “Invasion of Privacy.” Timothy Stanley Historian I cannot predict the winner of the Grammys because I don't listen to contemporary music; it all sounds like noise to me, either people shouting at each other or operating industrial machinery. I am amused, though, to see Rick Astley is recording again -- that man really never gives up. I'd give the prize to him. Alice Stewart CNN political commentator I am not a fan of potty-mouth music, so that doesn’t help in my predictions. I would like to see Brandi Carlile’s “By the Way, I Forgive You” album win, but I believe Drake’s “Scorpion” will get the nod in 2019. Holly Thomas CNN opinion contributor The “Black Panther” album is wicked, but I suspect it will be either Janelle Monae’s year or Drake’s. Drake has a lot of nominations though, so perhaps Monae will take best album and he can hoover up the rest. I guess it all comes down to (sorry) God’s Plan. Jeff Yang CNN opinion contributor The Robert Mueller Sessions, Vol. 1-8 would be my pick, but it’ll probably be “Black Panther.” However, anyone but Post Malone is fine by me.

2019 Who will win the World Series? And who will win the MLB’s first regular season London games in June -- the Yankees, the Red Sox, or will there be a split? The Yankees won both games in London. SE Cupp CNN commentator I always have to bet on my Mets -- because by law Mets fans are required to be delusional. But in reality, the Red Sox for the series win and for the London games. Jill Filipovic CNN opinion contributor Let's say Red Sox for both, because even spending almost all of one's adult life in New York can't make a person root for the Yankees. James Gagliano CNN law enforcement analyst I do this every year -- vote with my heart and choose my hometown Atlanta Braves. And since I’m married to a diehard New York Yankees fan – the Yanks over the Sawx in London. Frida Ghitis CNN opinion contributor The Los Angeles Dodgers will win the World Series. The Yankees will win the London series. The Brits will fiercely debate the merits of baseball and conclude with great satisfaction that, while their brush with baseball was not quite a damp squib, cricket remains superior. Joey Jackson CNN legal analyst Yankees & Yankees. They are overdue, and they have the talent to make great things happen. Scott Jennings CNN contributor St. Louis Cardinals ride Paul Goldschmidt’s 40 home runs campaign to the World Series title. Red Sox beat Yanks overseas. Roxanne Jones CNN opinion contributor And the Yankees win -- including in London. No way my team allows the Red Sox, Astros, Dodgers or any other team to ruin our dynasty. Loaded with cash to spend on super star free agents, the Commissioner’s Trophy returns home to New York in 2019. Peniel Joseph CNN opinion contributor Yankees for both, since they have upgraded their pitching and have several important players returning to start their lineup. Dean Obeidallah CNN opinion contributor The NY Mets will turn it around and stun the world in 2019. The Yankees will sweep the London series, beating the Red Sox so badly that some Red Sox players will actually defect to the United Kingdom instead of returning home to face the embarrassment. Jen Psaki CNN political commentator Red Sox in the US, Red Sox in London. The only thing I like about baseball is hot dogs, so I am relying on my baseball-loving husband for his prediction. Raul Reyes CNN opinion contributor The Dodgers are going to win the series because I am from LA, and I believe! Go Dodger Blue! The Red Sox will win the MLB London games. Timothy Stanley Historian I don't follow baseball, but I've lived in Washington, DC, so my team is the Nationals. For London, I think the British would most enjoy a Red Sox win. Alice Stewart CNN political commentator I’m a Braves fan, but I predict the Houston Astros will win the World Series in 2019. They have a strong pitching rotation with Justin Verlander and Gerrit Cole -- and that will help in the coming year. It will be exciting to watch MLB in London and see how folks across the pond respond. I would like to see a split with Yankees and Red Sox each winning a game. Holly Thomas CNN opinion contributor I am terrible on sport, for which I would rather blame traumatic physical education experiences than an inherent disinterest in teamwork (ahem). However, my highly scientific Twitter survey earlier today suggested that the Dodgers are a reasonable shout for the Series, and the Red Sox will win the closely-contested London games. Jeff Yang CNN opinion contributor I'm going to say the Yankees for both. Don't Aaron Judge me.

2019 What will President Trump’s approval rating be at the end of 2019? SE Cupp CNN commentator I’m guessing Democratic investigations will actually help him slightly, so I’ll put him at a 48%. Jill Filipovic CNN opinion contributor Forty percent because a lot of people are terrible. James Gagliano CNN law enforcement analyst Somewhere around the intersection of “piss a third of the country off,” “make a third of the country gleeful” and “leave all of us wondering why no one spellchecks his tweets prior to posting.” Which is to say, I think his approval will be a soft 42%. Frida Ghitis CNN opinion contributor In the months ahead, Americans will learn more about the dealings of the Trump campaign, the Trump presidency and the Trump family. The investigations brewing for the past two years will come to a boil and the Democratic-led House of Representatives will hold public hearings on scandal after scandal. Approval rating: 29%. Joey Jackson CNN legal analyst Thirty-three percent -- he is just too disruptive and divisive. Additionally, he will be impeached by then. Scott Jennings CNN contributor I think it’ll remain close to what it is today, ending at 42%. Roxanne Jones CNN opinion contributor Trump’s approval rating will hover around 35%, unless the President can deflect America's attention from the results of Mueller’s Russia investigation. Trump will be impeached by the House, and even if the mostly-GOP Senate fails to convict, Trump will be disgraced and pressured to resign. Peniel Joseph CNN opinion contributor Forty percent. The President manages to hold onto virtually 100% of his base of support, irrespective of his policies, speeches or actions. Dean Obeidallah CNN opinion contributor That assumes Trump will be President. If he is still President by then, I think it’ll hover at 35%. Jen Psaki CNN political commentator Under 40. How far under 40 depends first on the economy and second on Mueller, but I’d predict just below 30%. Raul Reyes CNN opinion contributor For the President, it is all downhill from here. With the Mueller probe notching more guilty pleas and indictments, and the economy showing signs of weakness, his approval rate will tumble to 33%. Timothy Stanley Historian Trump’s approval rating seems to have a ceiling of 45% and is heavily concentrated in rural areas. I predict it will remain just that. He deserves to poll better given the state of the economy, yet cannot make inroads because his personality and cultural politics alienate half the country. He is the embodiment of polarization. Alice Stewart CNN political commentator Fearing the outcome of the Mueller investigation, I expect President Trump’s approval rating at the end of 2019 will drop to around 40% -- with disapproval of 55%. A strong economy will go a long way to helping the approval rating. Holly Thomas CNN opinion contributor I think the President's approval rating will be 37% -- similar to his lowest point so far (as a pollster average) in December last year. Pressure is mounting on all sides -- from Mueller to clashes with Congress over the border wall to the continued revelations about his seemingly crooked property empire. Jeff Yang CNN opinion contributor I think that it is a safe bet that Donald Trump will set a record for lowest approval before next year is out (and before he is). My prediction: based on Gallup polling dating back to Harry Truman’s presidency, Trump would be the first POTUS in recent history with a sub-20% rating.

2019 Who will win the Super Bowl? The New England Patriots beat the Los Angeles Rams in the lowest-scoring Super Bowl in history. SE Cupp CNN commentator Green Bay Packers -- it’s our year, I can feel it. Jill Filipovic CNN opinion contributor My hometown team, the Seattle Seahawks. James Gagliano CNN law enforcement analyst With my beloved Atlanta Falcons all but eliminated from playoff contention, how many days until pitchers and catchers report? But if I'm to be forced into this, I think it will be the Houston Texans, who beat the Chicago Bears, 35-17. Frida Ghitis CNN opinion contributor The New Orleans Saints will defeat the Kansas City Chiefs. It will be a great match, but with smallish-city teams in the big game, viewership will be at record lows. Joey Jackson CNN legal analyst Los Angeles Rams -- great young quarterback, talented running back and lots of secret weapons. Scott Jennings CNN contributor Los Angeles Rams. Roxanne Jones CNN opinion contributor Coach Sean Payton and his New Orleans Saints will win the Super Bowl in Atlanta. I had sweet dreams of my Philadelphia Eagles repeating this season, but those dreams died long ago. Peniel Joseph CNN opinion contributor Dallas Cowboys. The addition of Amari Cooper, the talent of Ezekial Elliot and the steadiness of Dak Prescott fuel the Cowboys toward a surprisingly deep playoff run and their first Super Bowl victory since 1996. Dean Obeidallah CNN opinion contributor New York Giants. Jen Psaki CNN political commentator New Orleans Saints -- rooting for the over-40 quarterback! Raul Reyes CNN opinion contributor The Super Bowl is in Atlanta, but the championship is going to the City of Angels -- Los Angeles Rams! Timothy Stanley Historian I have no idea who will win the Super Bowl, but I'm a Catholic and I've always liked the name "Arizona Cardinals." It makes me think of a priest on horseback. Alice Stewart CNN political commentator I’m going to go with Drew Brees and the New Orleans Saints. They have had a strong offensive season, and they get bonus points for having “Choppa Style” dance moves to help them celebrate. I also expect Drew Brees to win MVP. Holly Thomas CNN opinion contributor Maroon 5 have already won -- I don’t care how many hits they have, it is absurd that they (probably) got that gig. But if you force me to choose an actual team, I’d say the Saints. Jeff Yang CNN opinion contributor Let’s go with the Kansas City Native Americans. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.

The short answer is that all of them appeared on Merriam-Webster's list of notable words of 2018.

The longer answer is that the words we look up and use to define or express ourselves tell the story of our lives, individually and as a country.

Several of these words tell the story of profound loss: "Maverick" spiked after the death of John McCain; "respect" following the passing of legendary Queen of Soul Aretha Franklin; "excelsior" in the wake of world-creator Stan Lee's departure.

One of these words also tells a story of empowerment: Merriam-Webster said lookups for "pansexual" surged after Janelle Monae came out as such in a cover story for Rolling Stone. Language clearly matters to Monae, whose groundbreaking album "Dirty Computer" earned a Grammy nomination for album of the year, and whose body of work , wrotein May, uses "unique style to create a vocabulary and cultural conversation about what it means to be a black woman in the United States," forging in the process "the intersectional feminism of our times."

Ruth Ben-Ghiat, "certainly tell(s) a story about the state of public consciousness." Justice "took a hit" in 2018, Ben-Ghiat said, but she embraced "freedom ... to write and say what we think" as her own word of the year. Ultimately, Merriam-Webster's word of the year was "justice," a choice that, in combination with Dictionary.com's "misinformation" and Oxford Dictionary's "toxic," asserted historian, "certainly tell(s) a story about the state of public consciousness." Justice "took a hit" in 2018, Ben-Ghiat said, but she embraced "freedom ... to write and say what we think" as her own word of the year.

In the young life of this column (and our newsletter , Provoke/Persuade), we've looked back each weekend at some of the strongest opinion of the preceding week. With a new year on the horizon, this week we're highlighting some of the top cultural criticism and social commentary of 2018. (You can also see our most popular CNN Opinion pieces here.)

A year of "Becoming" a nation embracing politics and poetry

asked a question If the words we look up tell our story in black and white, the books we read give that story color. In Electric Literature, Rebecca Makkaiasked a question many could relate to : "The world's on fire. Can we still talk about books?"

(Spoiler alert: Yes, and how!)

Gene Seymour, Even in the midst of a low point in American race relations, observed black storytelling on screen and on the page -- from "Black Panther" to "If Beale Street Could Talk" to electrifying debut fiction and poetry collections -- "showed a broad multiplicity of voices and made a deep impact on pop culture throughout 2018."

Weeks later, as the French played for the World Cup title, the world watched as a team made up of primarily black and Muslim players lifted the trophy. For Joseph, the victory was a rare moment of optimism for the future of immigration, globalization, and citizenship.

To borrow from, whose commentary on the Kilauea Volcano was one of CNN Opinion's top reads of the year , I might apply this quotation to 2018 itself:

(CNN) In a year dominated by the Trump presidency and the run-up to the midterm elections, readers came to CNN Opinion looking for insight into the ongoing battles raging in Washington and across America. But politicians and policy divides weren't the only headline makers. Stories of gun violence, celebrity deaths, a royal wedding and a series of horrific natural disasters attracted your attention, too.

Here are excerpts from a selection of some of the most popular opinion pieces of 2018.

Julian Zelizer: Obama's stern warning for Trump

January 13

To say that Donald Trump is not acting presidential is not to romanticize what we have seen from previous inhabitants of the office. But it is to hold him accountable for going far beyond the proper limits on presidential behavior.

The biggest danger is that by tolerating Trump's behavior in office, the public will make what he is doing and saying part of our conception of what it means to be presidential.

It is vital that members of both parties admit what they see when these moments happen and avoid normalizing these kinds of reckless departures from presidential history. For if the political class, and the public, starts to brush these moments off as "Trump being Trump" or "nothing worse than what we have seen" we will lower the bar so far it will be impossible to ever repair the presidency.

Lucia Brawley: Let's be honest about Aziz Ansari

Lucia Brawley

January 17

As a society, we must take this incident -- appearing in the public consciousness during our #MeToo moment -- as an opportunity to have some painful, nuanced conversations.

For example: Sexual assault and rape are never the victim's fault. But we cannot indiscriminately start destroying careers over consensual sexual activity, which based on her account is what this case appears to be.

When we do that, we trivialize the brave victims who are coming forward about actual sex crimes.

Simone Biles: I went from foster care to the Olympics

Simone Biles

February 5

Although I was young when my foster care ordeal began, I remember how it felt to be passed off and overlooked. Like nobody knew me or wanted to know me. Like my talents didn't count, and my voice didn't matter.

Finding a family made me feel like I mattered. Finding a passion, something I loved and was really good at, made me feel like I mattered. Representing my country and being part of such an amazing Olympic team matters, as does being a role model for those looking to fulfill their own dreams.

Cameron Kasky, Parkland student: My generation won't stand for this

Cameron Kasky

February 15

We can't ignore the issues of gun control that this tragedy raises. And so, I'm asking -- no, demanding -- we take action now.

Why? Because at the end of the day, the students at my school felt one shared experience -- our politicians abandoned us by failing to keep guns out of schools.

But this time, my classmates and I are going to hold them to account. This time we are going to pressure them to take action. This time we are going to force them to spend more energy protecting human lives than unborn fetuses.

Peggy Drexler: Why does Melania stay?

Peggy Drexler

February 17

But perhaps most important, although divorcing Trump would surely please the "Free Melania" crowd, the first lady hasn't really shown that she cares much what other people think of her -- or needs to be saved.

She has not tried particularly hard to win public approval: Besides her scant appearances and botched RNC address, she's become known for wearing the wrong things at the wrong time, like when she donned a pair of Manolos to visit victims of Hurricane Harvey. Which is also why it's perhaps too hopeful to expect that the pressure of these new revelations (which, let's be honest, are likely not new to her) will cause her to leave the life she seems comfortable in -- one that's very clearly sponsored by, if not warmly inclusive of, the President.

Gloria Borger: The great unraveling: Trump's allies are really worried about him

Gloria Borger

March 2

Not since Richard Nixon started talking to the portraits on the walls of the West Wing has a president seemed so alone against the world.

One source -- who is a presidential ally -- is worried, really worried. ...

Even by Trumpian standards, the chaos and the unraveling at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue are a stunning -- and recurring -- problem.

But there's an up-against-the-wall quality to the past couple of weeks that is striking, and the crescendo is loud, clear, unhealthy, even dangerous.

Paul Callan: The lawyer Trump wants to represent him has been dead for 32 years

Paul Callan

March 24

It's becoming increasingly clear who President Donald Trump really wants to represent him in the Robert Mueller investigation -- and there's a good reason he can't have him.

When John Dowd quit this week as lead counsel on Trump's legal team and the President made an effort to recruit "deep state" conspiracy theorist and conservative legal commentator Joseph diGenova to the team, the conclusion could only be that Trump wants to go to war against Mueller, using the tactics favored by his onetime mentor Roy Cohn.

In effect, the President wants to wage an aggressive, and probably dirty war, on the special counsel. Cohn, having died in 1986, isn't available. But there may be other lawyers who can fill that role

Jonathan Wackrow, former Secret Service agent: Barbara Bush's code name was absolutely perfect

Jonathan Wacrkrow

April 19

As a special agent with the United States Secret Service, I had the opportunity to work on many protective assignments with Mrs. Bush. While I was never permanently assigned to her detail, I am thankful for two specific moments with Mrs. Bush, ones I will cherish as defining experiences in my career and testaments to her legacy, her candor and grace.

The first occurred when I was a new agent, assigned to work a midnight shift at the Bush family's summer residence in Kennebunkport, Maine. I was walking in the front yard at daybreak, preparing to end my shift, when Mrs. Bush suddenly appeared.

In my world, it was better to be unseen, but in this instant, I was in the former first lady's full view with nowhere to hide. Mrs. Bush gave me the warmest smile and said, "Well, it is good morning for me, but it looks like you have been up all night, so I will wish you a good night's sleep." Stunned, I thanked her.

Paul Begala: Sean Hannity is a welfare queen

Paul Begala

April 23

Sean Hannity is a lot of things. Needy isn't one of them. Greedy, in President Reagan's framing, seems more like it. Perhaps the program that guarantees Hannity's investments is a wise one. Perhaps, on the other hand, it is a wasteful welfare program. That's not the point. It's the hypocrisy, stupid.

Hannity is a very wealthy man. So is Donald Trump. It appears that part of the way they became rich was by decrying welfare for poor folks, then grabbing it for themselves. They view their voters, their viewers, as saps. Stooges. Suckers. As another great huckster said, there's one born every minute. And Hannity is laughing all the way to the bank.

Einat Lev: Why Hawaii's volcano is in danger of going ballistic

Einat Lev

May 10

Everyone has been looking at the Kilauea Volcano's lava flows. Sure, a wall of molten rock consuming a car is quite the sight. But as we all focus on the damage at Leilani Estates, we shouldn't forget that volcanoes are complex systems, where everything is connected. New warnings about flying ballistic blocks and sinking lava lakes help us remember!

This event -- beautiful, destructive, frightening -- also presents a moment for all of us to appreciate the immense power of the forces that never cease shaping our planet. We are reminded by Kilauea to stay humble in the face of nature. And for volcanologists, the eruption is an opportunity to share with the public what we know about how these massive, intricate systems work.

Michael D'Antonio: What Ivanka's smile can't hide

Michael D'Antonio

May 14

Ivanka's smile was undoubtedly offered to calm concerns about him and, perhaps, to distract from the mayhem and death that any thoughtful person could have anticipated as the embassy opened and Trump abandoned America's claim to honest broker status in the Middle East.

It was the biggest test yet of Ivanka's ability to cast a benign light on a man who regularly creates a shadow too dark for her to dispel.

Ford Vox: What the $%#@ is wrong with you? Of course it's Yanny! (or Laurel)

Ford Vox

May 16

But if you're shocked by the Yanny and Laurel differences in your own household and social networks, by all means use this as a moment to reflect on what else you might perceive differently, in the political messaging swirling around us.

Illusions like this fascinate us because they reveal there is a gap between what we perceive to be true and what actually exists. It's baked into our biology; we're equipped with brains that spend far more of their energy and devote far more network activity to processing and changing what we sense. Nothing gets in that isn't dramatically altered before it reaches our conscious awareness.

All knowledge is a feat of human interpretation. These periodic revelations that we see things differently are one of the all-too-fleeting healthy forces of social media, reminding us that we have to work together if we're going to get things right.

Isha Sesay

May 19

In a short period, Meghan Markle has ushered in a new sensibility and made the world recalibrate how it thinks about this family we thought we already knew so well.

The Duchess of Sussex chose to make her wedding day a moment where the world tuned in and were made to think about racial equality and gender equality. She made a decision to send the world a message.

It was a decision she made with her husband and with the blessing of the members of her new family. And it was powerful.

Hilary George-Parkin: What Kate Spade modeled for young women -- and their moms

Hilary George-Parkin

June 5

There's a reason Kate Spade's work appealed just as much to a generation of 12-year-old girls as it did to their moms. At its core, it made the case that femininity, creativity and a sense of playfulness weren't qualities you needed to give up or hide away in order to be taken seriously in the world -- that, in fact, they should be celebrated. It was an idealistic notion, but the woman at the helm, who built what would become a multibillion-dollar brand on boxy handbags and polka-dot prints, was all the proof we needed.

The idea that whimsy should have a place in the workplace, that "sophisticated" doesn't need to mean "staid," that prints should be mixed and colors can be clashed, were, in many ways, ahead of their time. In an industry of dark sunglasses and status handbags, she embraced an unapologetically pretty, preppy, East Coast aesthetic, turning it on its head in the process.

S. Nathan Park: US-North Korea friendship would be the perfect bulwark against China

S. Nathan Park

June 6

In short, North Korea is in serious need of a military and economic counterweight against China -- and the United States can serve in that capacity. True, it is distasteful to be friends with a regime responsible for massive human rights violations. Yet pragmatism is a longstanding tradition in US foreign relations. Just consider that Mao Zedong was on the short list of history's greatest monsters, but Richard Nixon shook his hand.

Pragmatists would look beyond the present conditions and examine how a friendly relationship with North Korea would serve the long-term US national interest. With the rise of China, East Asia is far and away the most important region in the world for the United States. If the United States could count North Korea as a friend, it would be adding a friendly state located at the doorstep of China.

Dean Obeidallah: Why Sarah Sanders was asked to leave a restaurant

Dean Obeidallah

June 24

Those shocked by these types of protests simply don't grasp the level of emotion that many who oppose Trump feel. I hear it nightly on my SiriusXM radio show and see it firsthand on social media. Even Trump, in a rare moment of honesty, told his supporters a few weeks ago that those who oppose him are not just angry, but "really, really angry." Many view Trump as a true threat to America.

So, it should come as no surprise that some would also look to hold members of Team Trump responsible as well. After all, Trump administration officials who defend Trump's bigoted policies, his demonization of minority groups and his lies, are complicit. They freely choose to do the work for him and they shouldn't be shocked if some -- not all --Trump opponents lash out at them.

David Axelrod: Annapolis victims worked hard and honorably to serve their community

David Axelrod

June 29

No, the shooter apparently wasn't motivated by politics. But the victims died because the newspaper faithfully discharged its obligation to cover the news. So this slaughter should give us pause to reflect on the essential role of the journalist in our society.

They work hard to get the straight and unvarnished facts to us, to shine a light in dark corners and make sure we know what is going on in our communities, our country and the world.

It is a mission to which they commit themselves, often for little money and sometimes at great risk -- even, as we now know, in the newsrooms of local papers.

LZ Granderson: I forgave my father for walking out on me. I hope he forgave me, too

LZ Granderson

July 7

I've been poor and rich. I've been another face in the crowd and a face on television. Inside a crack house and a guest at the White House. And at each junction of my life, the demons regarding my father followed. They had an open invitation courtesy of the anger I kept in my heart. It wasn't until my son asked why hasn't he ever met his grandfather that I realized how foolish I had been.

I wasn't trying to protect my kid. I was trying to punish an absentee father, losing sight of the fact that forgiveness isn't for the offender, but for the offended.

I went to the nursing home hoping to jog his memory, like a scene from "The Notebook." I took my phone out to Facetime, so my son could see and talk to his grandfather for the first time. And I went to the nursing home to say, "I forgive you."

Peniel Joseph: France's World Cup win is a victory for immigrants everywhere

Peniel Joseph

July 15

In short, the World Cup champions remind us all that, in an era of globalization, racial and ethnic diversity represent an enduring strength at all levels of society, ones that build cultural and political bridges within and between countries.

For millions of soccer fans around the world, Africa, in effect, just won the World Cup! This is more than just wishful thinking. The makeup of the French team represents a powerful response against building walls and detention centers to detain and dehumanize immigrant populations.

The global debate over immigration is the human rights issue of our time. How are we to treat the women, men, children and families who risk their lives for opportunities that thrive in Western society?

Ruth Ben-Ghiat: Trump and Putin: the pictures tell the story

Ruth Ben-Ghiat

July 18

The meeting in Helsinki, Finland, between two men expert in the art of spectacle intended to intimidate the world, proclaiming that Trump's reorientation of America away from liberal democracy is in line with the intentions of his counterpart, Russian President Vladimir Putin.

The images tell another story: one that gives credence to the belief that Trump's allegiance to Putin goes way beyond ideology. We still don't know the actual reason the summit was held, nor do we know -- yet -- the nature of the hold Putin has over Trump. Yet photographs suggest this was no meeting of equals but an encounter between a supplicant (Trump) and a master (Putin), starting with Putin arriving late to their public encounter, setting it about 45 minutes back.

Manisha Sinha: What happened the last time a President chose America's enemies over its friends

Manisha Sinha

July 25

Donald Trump likes to compare himself to Andrew Jackson, but the Andrew he really resembles is Andrew Johnson. What they have in common are delusions of personal grandeur and a tainted ascent to the presidency. Trump was elected by a minority of the American electorate, with help from the vagaries of the Electoral College system and from considerable Russian interference.

Johnson became president thanks to an assassin's bullet. While Johnson immodestly compared himself to Jesus and Moses, Trump claims he is the best at everything, even boasting recently on Twitter that his popularity among Republicans exceeds that of Abraham Lincoln. ...

But the resemblance between the two men goes deeper. Johnson's white supremacist views were blatant and his policies precipitated a constitutional crisis that put the President at loggerheads with Congress and his own party, the Republicans.

SE Cupp: What Laura Ingraham said was awful. And unsurprising.

SE Cupp

August 9

To many, that sounded racist. That's because it is. She isn't complaining that the country's getting older or younger, richer or poorer, that we're having more or fewer children or moving to the suburbs. She's complaining that people who come to America from other countries -- even legally -- are making this country unrecognizable to her. Indeed, to "us."

Who "us" means is also clear: Fox News viewers, who are predominantly 65 and older and white. I know many of those viewers, and I'm sad to say that message probably resonated with a lot of them.

Timothy Stanley: What it tells us that John McCain drank vodka with Hillary Clinton

Timothy Stanley

August 25

John McCain once took on Hillary Clinton in a drinking contest. It was at a restaurant in Estonia in 2004, during a congressional tour. Both politicians managed four shots of vodka; the rules were unclear, but Clinton -- McCain's one-time political rival -- was declared the winner, according to the restaurant proprietor (though in her own account, Clinton said they "agreed to withdraw in honorable fashion," rather than name a winner).

That image sums up the humanity and character of the late Sen. McCain, who will be mourned deeply on both sides of the political aisle. He embodied a more moderate brand of conservatism -- one that could separate politics and friendship -- that now feels distant and very much missed.

He should have been elected President in 2000, when he ran for the Republican nomination and lost, and if he had made it to the White House, America might have forged a new consensus around a smaller state and a cleaner politics.

Today the country is divided in ways that McCain despaired of. But it should be united in grief for a genuine American hero.

Joshua Geltzer: How to prepare for ex-President Trump

Joshua Geltzer

August 30

No one knows how Trump will leave the Oval Office. Maybe he'll resign. Maybe he'll be impeached. Maybe he'll be voted out in November 2020 -- or maybe he'll leave at the end of two terms in January 2025.

But however he becomes an ex-president, it's impossible to imagine Trump following in Richard Nixon's post-presidency footsteps -- ones that literally traversed empty beaches in a solitary existence. Whether Trump leaves of his own accord after eight years or is abruptly cast out by a vote of the Senate or Electoral College, he is not one to go quietly into the night.

Remember: This is the only presidential candidate in recent memory who refused, even when he appeared to be on the brink of losing the election, to commit to accepting the outcome of the vote. In a career that's careened from real estate to reality TV to politics, there's been one constant: a thirst for more attention.

Danielle Campoamor: Ariana Grande reminds us women have no safe place in America

Danielle Campoamor

September 3

After Grande's performance, the Rev. Charles H. Ellis III wrapped his right arm around Grande, pulled her close to him and touched her breast. He did this on stage, in a church, during a funeral -- in front of thousands of attendees. Visibly uncomfortable and tense, Grande forced her way through awkward laughs as to not make a scene at the Queen of Soul's eight-hour funeral. ...

The majority of us have felt what Grande undoubtedly felt on that stage: the undeniable fear that accompanies a violation; the need to keep everyone around you happy while you're internally screaming; the cultural expectation to keep smiling while your bodily autonomy is wholly dismissed.

To watch it play out at a funeral is not to be shocked by what you've witnessed, but to be reminded that women -- no matter how powerful or famous -- are not granted the same public safety as men.

Marianna Spicer Joslyn: I was Anthony Bourdain's 'censor' at CNN

September 22

Like his viewers, I fell in love with Tony. He was a brilliant writer and storyteller, and you saw his toughness and sensed his vulnerability. His team at ZPZ are the most gifted filmmakers I have seen in a long, long time. His shows were brilliantly shot, directed and edited, always. His writing was poetry, although his friends say he denied being a poet.

I can't begin to tell you how much I appreciate and will miss my small part in this program. And my small connection with one of the most brilliant storytellers of our generation. I will miss his voice. I already miss his voice.

I have no claim to being more distraught over Tony's passing than any of his fans, and not in the same league as those who knew and worked with him. But like those who did know him well, I am really angry at his loss, and deeply sad. His kind won't come our way again.

Rebecca Wanzo: These images of women around Kavanaugh evoke a familiar alibi

Rebecca Wanzo

September 26

This choice is an extension of a strategy we have seen even before the accusations against Brett Kavanaugh emerged late in the confirmation process. Kavanaugh stands poised to be the justice who will cement an anti-abortion rights court. With images of him with his wife, daughters, law clerks, and young female basketball players, he is framed as a man who supports women and their futures. (Kavanaugh has vigorously denied the allegations.)

They were front and center in the hearings -- a visual counterargument to the idea that women's lives and bodies are not safe in his hands. Now that some women have accused him of assaulting them, the images are even more important. The happy, shining faces of these teenage girls are meant to inspire trust.

Images sell the idea that these girls have been safe in his hands. How could anyone imagine that this man, trusted and loved, would hurt them? And if he has not hurt them, how could he have hurt any other young woman?

Jennifer Taub: Brett Kavanaugh and I have a lot in common

Jennifer Taub

September 28

We both were raised with conservative politics and attended elite prep schools. We both are religious, with deep faith and a belief in God. We both attended Yale in the mid-1980s. We both, aside from occasional binge drinking, worked hard in school and wrote for the student newspaper. We both studied at Cross Campus Library. We both managed to get into top-tier law schools. He Yale, me Harvard. Although we shared similarities, I do not recall ever meeting him at Yale.

But there is one place where our similarities end, and that has made all the difference in our lives. While Brett Kavanaugh appears to have moved fluidly from his beer-drinking prep school days into his beer-drinking college years, I was not as fortunate.

In early fall of my freshman year at Yale, I was raped by an upperclassman. Until that moment, I had expected to maintain my virginity until I was married, or at least until I fell deeply in love. Some of the details are forever seared into my memory, like they were in Christine Blasey Ford's.

Nic Robertson: The world's leaders may regret laughing at Donald Trump

Nic Robertson

September 29

It was also a laugh that the world -- or at least its leaders -- had at the expense of President Trump.

Beginning his speech at the United Nations General Assembly this week, Trump didn't appear to expect the humorous interlude as he launched into a recital of his achievements in office to date.

There was no serious stumble, but a short pause, perhaps taking in what was happening. ...

The lesson for UN delegates who may have laughed is this: Hope you don't get found out.

President Trump likes respect. He won't forget. And he may get the last laugh.

Kelley Paul: My husband, Rand Paul, and our family have suffered intimidation and threats

Kelley Paul and US Sen. Rand Paul

October 3

Earlier this week, Rand was besieged in the airport by activists "getting up in his face," as you, Sen. Booker, encouraged them to do a few months ago. Preventing someone from moving forward, thrusting your middle finger in their face, screaming vitriol -- is this the way to express concern or enact change? Or does it only incite unstable people to violence, making them feel that assaulting a person is somehow politically justifiable?

Sen. Booker, Rand has worked with you to co-sponsor criminal justice reform bills. He respects you, and so do I. I would call on you to retract your statement. I would call on you to condemn violence, the leaking of elected officials' personal addresses (our address was leaked from a Senate directory given only to senators), and the intimidation and threats that are being hurled at them and their families.

Jeffrey Sachs: Trump's failure to fight climate change is a crime against humanity

Jeffrey Sachs

October 18

President Donald Trump, Florida Gov. Rick Scott, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, and others who oppose action to address human-induced climate change should be held accountable for climate crimes against humanity. They are the authors and agents of systematic policies that deny basic human rights to their own citizens and people around the world, including the rights to life, health and property. These politicians have blood on their hands, and the death toll continues to rise.

Trump remains in willful denial of the thousands of deaths caused by his government's inept, under-funded, and under-motivated response to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico last year. The image that will remain in history is of the President gleefully throwing paper towels for a photo op as the people of Puerto Rico around him suffered and died of neglect. In September, Hurricane Florence claimed at least 48 lives, with more likely to come in its aftermath. Last month, Hurricane Michael claimed at least 32 lives, with more than a thousand people reportedly still missing. The final death toll will likely soar in the months ahead as the residual consequences of the storm become more clear.

Kate Maltby: Pray that you don't win the billion-dollar lottery

Kate Maltby

October 22

This week, the winners of two high-rolling lottery jackpots may get to live out their own big-spending fantasies. Tuesday's MegaMillions drawing stands at $1.6 billion and Wednesday's lesser Powerball is still no snip at $620 million. There isn't even a promise of alien invasion to cut short the spending window.

But in life, as in fiction, there's always still a catch. Is an overnight windfall of this magnitude really worth the hassle? Earlier this year, a New Hampshire woman sued for the right to retain anonymity while claiming her Powerball prize of $560 million. Most states still consider the identity of lottery winners a matter of public record.

If that sounds like a price worth paying for a half a billion-life change, bear in mind the number of lottery winners who've met grisly ends after the news of their winnings spread.

Tim Naftali: The midterms put our system against the Agitator in Chief

Tim Naftali

October 24

Historically, the balancing against power in Washington has happened despite the fact that too many of us view elections -- especially midterms -- as spectator sports or don't care about them at all. How this can be in a country that prides itself on the blessings of liberty is a question for another time. But what if this healthy cycle of rebalancing is broken in 2018 despite two years of Trumpian chaos, disrespect for large swathes of our society and daily contempt for dissent?

With only a matter of days to go, the outcome of the struggle in the current three-person race among center-left anger, Trumpist rage and widespread apathy remains remarkably TBD. If our Agitator in Chief's 2018 Provocation Tour falls short, Donald J. Trump will be the clear loser and our constitutional system the winner. But if he manages to cheat history, our political system will face its strongest stress test in the modern era.

Van Jones: 16 reasons to be excited about the midterm Rainbow Wave

Van Jones

November 7

In this election, we witnessed the end of two years of one-party rule and the beginning of a new Democratic Party: younger, browner, cooler; with more women, more veterans and the ability to contest and win races from the deep South to the Midwest. ... I call this torrent of inclusive populism "The Rainbow Wave." Here is why I am excited about this peek into the future of our nation and the Democratic Party:

1. Michigan's Rashida Tlaib and Minnesota's Ilhan Omar, both Democrats, will be the first Muslim women in the House of Representatives.

2. Sharice Davids of Kansas and Deb Haaland of New Mexico, also Democrats, will be the first Native American women in the House of Representatives.

3. Colorado Democrat Jared Polis will be the nation's first openly gay governor. Sharice Davids, mentioned above, is also part of the LGBT community. Democrat Kyrsten Sinema still stands a chance of being the first openly bisexual senator.

Don Lincoln: A dark matter hurricane is headed our way

Don Lincoln

November 19

According to a recent paper, the Earth is caught directly in the crosshairs of a cosmic hurricane. A swarm of nearly 100 stars, accompanied by an even greater amount of dark matter, is aimed directly at our stellar neighborhood and there's nothing we can do to stop it; in fact, the vanguard is already upon us. This sounds like a perfect summer blockbuster movie, starring The Rock and Chris Pratt, or maybe Scarlett Johansson and Charlize Theron.

Except this is for real. But is it a danger? Well, actually, no. Not at all. But it's potentially incredibly fascinating, with lots of interesting scientific interconnections.

Marcus Mabry: America faces a crossroads after George H.W. Bush's death

Marcus Mabry

December 1

Agree or disagree with Bush's politics, it is his profound decency that is his legacy. Just one example: Read his letter to Bill Clinton after he lost the 1992 election. That dignity and decorum is, perhaps, the greatest difference between Trump and his predecessors.

That decency deficit is what has led a handful of Republicans to repudiate Trump's politics and tone -- and many more did so before he was the party's nominee.

But today's Republican Party is the party of Trump, not the party of Bush.

And America is at a crossroads. The suburban vote in the midterm elections suggested that many swing voters reject Trump's divisiveness. But do they accept the burdens of global leadership that George H.W. Bush embraced?"

Elie Honig: Mueller is about to have his say -- in a big way

Throughout his investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election, special counsel Robert Mueller has imposed on his team an ironclad rule: Nobody leaks and nobody speaks -- out of court, that is. But when it comes to official court filings -- indictments, plea agreements, sentencing memos -- Mueller has been loquacious and at times downright chatty, disclosing in compelling narrative fashion crucial details about his investigation and giving tantalizing clues about what might happen next. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) I could tell that the walls of the room were originally white, but years of dirty hands, sun and time had made them dull. The yellowish hue from the fluorescent lights hanging above didn't help. Thankfully, the generic floral pictures hanging near the man sitting on the edge of the bed provided some semblance of joy. Nothing else in the room did -- especially me.

I was in a nursing home.

The man sitting on the edge of the bed was my father.

And this would be the last day I would see him alive.

In healthy father-son relationships, when the parent dies the child mourns. But considering that more than 20 years had passed since my father and I had seen each other, you could say we didn't have a healthy relationship.

When I was in elementary school he would occasionally pick me up on the weekends and we'd watch the Detroit Tigers on the television in his kitchen. I once spent an entire summer with him watching baseball and learning how to fish. Then one day, without explanation, he stopped coming around.

I once ran away from my mother's home, showed up at his place begging for him to take me in, and he drove me back without hesitation. More than five years would go by before I would see him again. Another three after that. Then finally some 20-odd years later in a dingy room of a nursing home in a suburb of Detroit.

I used to say that 23 chromosomes and disappointment were the only things my father contributed to my life. It was my way of laughing through pain I couldn't acknowledge.

Over time the desperation to be a part of his life turned into resentment and anger over him not wanting to be a part of mine. When my mother told me a couple of years ago that he had Alzheimer's disease I coldly replied: "He didn't know me before; what does it matter if he doesn't recognize me now?"

I'm aware such an admission reflects poorly on me. But I don't write this to make myself look good. I don't pretend I've evolved or that I have all the answers. I write because we all have our struggles.

I've been poor and rich. I've been another face in the crowd and a face on television. Inside a crack house and a guest at the White House. And at each junction of my life, the demons regarding my father followed. They had an open invitation courtesy of the anger I kept in my heart. It wasn't until my son asked why hasn't he ever met his grandfather that I realized how foolish I had been.

I wasn't trying to protect my kid. I was trying to punish an absentee father, losing sight of the fact that forgiveness isn't for the offender, but for the offended.

I went to the nursing home hoping to jog his memory, like a scene from "The Notebook." I took my phone out to Facetime, so my son could see and talk to his grandfather for the first time. And I went to the nursing home to say "I forgive you."

But the disease had progressed too far. He smiled but he didn't know who I was. My son was happy to see his grandfather's face, but no conversation ensued. My father was incapable of comprehending what was being said or forming sentences of his own. I looked him in the eyes and told him "I forgive you," but if he understood, he didn't show it.

In March I learned that my father died. I didn't cry. Instead, I mourned the fact I didn't care enough about him to cry. I thought about all the time I let slip by because I wanted to show everyone how strong I was. I thought about the memories I had robbed from my son. And I thought: You don't always know what people are going through when they hurt the ones they love, and you may never find out if you don't have enough forgiveness in your heart to ask.

I went to the nursing home that day because I was finally ready to ask. The reward for my foolish pride is spending the rest of my life without an answer.

On Father's Day this year I woke up to several text messages from well-wishers. Some friends gave me a card raving about what a great dad I am. My son sent his love. I checked baseball scores to see if the Tigers won the night before. They did, 7-5 over the Chicago White Sox.

I closed my eyes and I could see a little boy watching the Tigers with his dad in the kitchen. I saw them fishing. Talking. I guess he did have a positive impact on my life after all. I opened my eyes, stared at the bright white ceiling in my room and finally allowed the tears for my father to fall, whispering -- "I hope you found it in your heart to forgive me too." <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

Prior to her 24 years at CNN, she was executive producer of CBS News' "Face the Nation," producer of ABC News' "This Week With David Brinkley," "World News Saturday and Sunday," and "The Health Show," and an associate producer and writer for CBS' 60 Minutes" and "CBS Reports."

No, we don't really have "censors," per se, at CNN -- we have Standards and Practices. I was the lucky one in our department to review "Parts Unknown" for things like graphic language or pictures, political bent or historical tweaking.

I never met him. I never even spoke to him. I didn't have to. He spoke to me, and everyone else, through his work.

As a former documentarian, I especially appreciated the sheer beauty of his programs, and the talents of his team. I was blown away by the photography, the direction, the editing and, of course, the writing.

As many have remarked, Bourdain had a very distinctive voice. As a writer for "60 Minutes," I did preliminary scripts for the likes of Mike Wallace, Ed Bradley and Diane Sawyer. I tried to hear their voices in my head as I wrote those initial tracks. I don't think I could have done that for Anthony Bourdain. His voice was too personal ... so visceral. I didn't know how he felt about what he was experiencing. Only he could tell us.

Tony -- and I think of him that way rather than by his formal name -- spoke plainly. Writers like him don't write to impress, they don't try to write poetry, and they don't even think about the impact their words will have. They write to share their experience as they are experiencing it -- not as a travelogue, but more trying to put you there with them. They can tell us what they see and hear and smell and taste and in a way that is organic.

For someone used to dealing with what news standards should be for our network, trying to find the "bar" for "Parts Unknown" was its own journey.

It's well known that Tony was profane. This was something new for CNN. We had hired him wanting him and everything that went along with it. But even though CNN is cable, it is also a brand. It's the most widely respected news network in the world, our viewers tell us, and we really don't want profane vernacular coming out of our anchors' mouths.

But we hired Tony to be Tony. Dilemma. So someone came up with the arbitrary "two shits per show." F-words were verboten and muted, although of course you could see what was being said. Tony joked about the "two shits" rule on late night TV and said he was negotiating for three for the next season.

I have to say, I eventually gave up on the "shits." But those weren't the biggest problem.

Tony loved talking about genitals. Mostly his. "Be careful after eating spicy foods to wash your hands before relieving yourself" was his favorite. Various bugs and reptiles climbing up his pants and endangering the jewels was another. Then there was the show where people were leaping in ponds and having to spend the rest of the day with "moist nuts."

Whenever the opportunity presented itself, Tony made sure you knew how his body functions were impacted. On a trip to the French Alps with his good buddy and fellow chef Eric Ripert, where both of them ate copious amounts of cheese fondue, Tony warned Eric that he would be having large, concrete-like bowel movements.

I learned that "crap" and "shit" were different. Who knew?

For one of the last episodes, about the Lower East Side of New York, I paid no attention to the "shits" uttered by Tony and his various guests. The multiple f-words, uttered equally by Tony and his dinner companions, would be muted.

But in this episode, Tony's guests were, hard to believe, more profane than he was. They told tales of 60's NYC and the very gritty art and music scene. A lunch companion, guest/singer/performer Lydia Lunch, spoke plainly about what it took to make it in the 60's -- hand jobs under the table to get her band to Europe. And that's one of her milder utterances. And millennials think they invented shock value. Let's just say "let it all hang out" wasn't a metaphor.

The producers at Zero Point Zero and I had many discussions over the dispatching of animals. I've since read what Tony wrote about that, and I wished I'd read it before. He was on the record as saying after he killed his first pig with a spear, which he felt obligated to do, having ordered the execution of many, many animals as a chef, he felt it was hypocritical not to show where our food comes from.

Again, cable is not necessarily cable news. I am an animal lover and admittedly in denial about continuing to eat meat while I can't stand the thought, let alone the sight, of killing animals. I didn't feel our audience was ready for Tony's level of reality. I challenged his executive producer with the question, "Would Tony want to bring a cow out to his dinner guests to see its butchering?" We compromised, but not much.

Of course, Tony was very, very funny. We had to seek a middle ground in many areas, especially politics. In one episode, Tony described a particularly disgusting-sounding food he tried somewhere in Africa as being so good he would "eat it out of Chris Christie's jock on a hot summer day." Besides the fact that, at the time, Christie was a sitting governor and a presidential candidate, there was the TMI factor. Then the "fat joke" factor. I have the fortunate alternative of kicking these decisions to the next level. It passed, under the "let Tony be Tony" rule.

Tony seemed to love all things shocking, not really a surprise given his personal journey, because after all, what was really shocking to him? In an episode on Tokyo, he reveled in following a couple who "taught" bondage. There were many extended scenes of "fun with ropes" that rubbed my bosses the wrong way -- if you'll forgive the pun -- but Tony loved it.

My responsibilities included looking at several cuts of each program -- rough cut, fine cut, picture lock. I actually needed to look at all the cuts because I was convinced Tony (or maybe his producers?) loved playing the game of "what else can I sneak in here that standards might miss on the second cut." Blurs needed to be checked and rechecked. Was there anything new? I'm sure I was just paranoid ... maybe.

One of my favorite challenges over the past five years was an episode on Chicago, where Tony visited a bar whose owner was also a painter. His work was primarily of political icons. One such painting was of Sarah Palin, naked, holding a shotgun, with a turkey being dispatched behind her. Uh. No. Please cover the vice presidential candidate's private parts. Made me think the show might be called "Private Parts Unknown."

Like his viewers, I fell in love with Tony. He was a brilliant writer and storyteller, and you saw his toughness and sensed his vulnerability. His team at ZPZ are the most gifted filmmakers I have seen in a long, long time. His shows were brilliantly shot, directed and edited, always. His writing was poetry, although his friends say he denied being a poet.

I can't begin to tell you how much I appreciate and will miss my small part in this program. And my small connection with one of the most brilliant storytellers of our generation. I will miss his voice. I already miss his voice.

I have no claim to being more distraught over Tony's passing than any of his fans, and not in the same league as those who knew and worked with him. But like those who did know him well, I am really angry at his loss, and deeply sad. His kind won't come our way again. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

The final death toll will likely soar in the months ahead as the residual consequences of the storm become more clear.

As the Earth warms due to the continued burning of coal, oil, and gas, climate-related disasters that include high-intensity hurricanes, floods, droughts, extreme precipitation, forest fires, and heat waves, pose rising dangers to life and property. Hurricanes become more destructive as warmer ocean waters feed more energy to the storms. Warmer air also carries more moisture for devastating rainfalls, while rising sea levels lead to more flooding.

Yet Trump and his minions are the loyal servants of the fossil-fuel industry, which fill Republican party campaign coffers. Trump has also stalled the fight against climate change by pulling out of the Paris Agreement. The politicians thereby deprive the people of their lives and property out of profound cynicism, greed, and willful scientific ignorance.

The first job of government is to protect the public. Real protection requires climate action on several fronts: educating the public about the growing dire risks of human-induced climate change; enacting legislation and regulations to ensure that families and businesses are kept out of harm's way, for example by stopping construction in flood plains, and investing in sustainable infrastructure to counteract rising sea levels; anticipating the rising frequency of high-intensity climate-related disasters through science-based preparedness following through on properly scaled disaster-response during and after storm events; and most importantly for the future, spearheading the rapid transition to zero-carbon energy to prevent much greater calamities in the years ahead. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) People love to ask: "What's your secret?" Sometimes they want to know how I defy gravity on the mat. Other times they want to know how I went from foster care to the Olympics.

My answer to both is the same: a mix of talent, hard work and grabbing the right opportunity when given the chance. When I was far too young to know it, others around me saw that I had a gift for gymnastics. Without their encouragement and support, I would have never been a gymnast.

I was blessed to have both a gift and the chance to develop it. But many people aren't so lucky.

Simone Biles

Did you know that in the United States there are nearly 400,000 children and youth in foster care? In my mind, those are 400,000 talents waiting to be discovered. But as few as 3% of foster kids go on to earn a bachelor's degree, compared to about 30% of the general population.

Is it possible that all of these young people have no desire to go on to higher education? Clearly not. They simply lack the support, and often the financial resources and opportunity to realize their potential.

(CNN) According to a recent paper , the Earth is caught directly in the crosshairs of a cosmic hurricane. A swarm of nearly 100 stars, accompanied by an even greater amount of dark matter, is aimed directly at our stellar neighborhood and there's nothing we can do to stop it; in fact, the vanguard is already upon us. This sounds like a perfect summer blockbuster movie, starring The Rock and Chris Pratt, or maybe Scarlett Johansson and Charlize Theron.

Except this is for real. But is it a danger? Well, actually, no. Not at all. But it's potentially incredibly fascinating, with lots of interesting scientific interconnections. So, what is really going on?

The story starts last April, when the Gaia satellite announced the locations and trajectories of 2 billion stars in the vicinity of the Milky Way surrounding our sun. They released the data to the public.

Scientists were then able to look at the data set to see if they could spot anything peculiar. In galaxies like the Milky Way, the most common behavior is that the stars orbit the center of the galaxy in a manner broadly similar to the planets orbiting our sun. However, there are some stars that exhibit unusual motion. About a year ago, astronomers identified some "stellar streams" passing through our celestial neighborhood.

One of them, called S1 (for stream 1), consists of nearly 100 stars of similar age and composition, orbiting the Milky Way in a direction exactly opposite that of normal stars. It's kind of like a handful of cars driving the wrong way down the highway, except with a much greater distance between them and with no likelihood of a collision. These stars are spread out over a few thousand light years and they will pass through the solar system's neighborhood over the course of a few million years.

Astronomers identified S1 as being part of the remnants of a dwarf galaxy that collided with the Milky Way and was consumed in an epic episode of cosmic cannibalism. Dwarf galaxies are very small, typically about 1% the mass of the Milky Way. They can orbit larger galaxies and collide with the bigger galaxy, adding their mass to the parent. This is what appears to have happened in the case of S1, although the process has taken probably a billion years.

Dwarf galaxies often have a disproportionately large fraction of dark matter. Dark matter is a hypothetical and still-undiscovered form of matter that interacts only gravitationally. Scientists have proposed its existence to explain many astronomical mysteries, for example the observation that most galaxies rotate faster than can be explained by the known laws of physics and the stars and gas of which they are composed.

While dark matter has not yet been observed, hypothesizing its existence is the simplest and most economical explanation for myriad astronomical mysteries. Averaged over the entire universe, dark matter is thought to be five times more prevalent than the ordinary mass of stars and gas and planets.

In dwarf galaxies, the fraction of dark matter is often higher. In Fornax, a well-studied dwarf galaxy orbiting the Milky Way, researchers estimate that the dark matter is between 10 and 100 times greater than the mass found in its stars.

If that number holds for S1, the dark matter of the S1 stream is passing through the Earth at a much higher velocity than the more ordinary dark matter that orbits the Milky Way -- about twice as fast. It is thought that S1 dark matter is flying through the solar system at a speed of about 550 km/s, or about 1.2 million mph. While these numbers are impressive, they are misleading. Dark matter, if it exists, is extremely diffuse and it will have no discernible effect on the solar system.

Because dark matter hasn't been observed yet, these velocity numbers are speculative, although they are strongly supported by a very large body of evidence. However, the prospect of high velocity dark matter flying through the Earth has suggested an opportunity to detect it.

In a paper in the prestigious journal Physical Review D, researcher Ciaran O'Hare and his collaborators calculated the possibilities of discovering dark matter using both existing and proposed dark matter detectors. They considered two varieties of dark matter particles: a very heavy kind called a WIMP (weakly interacting massive particle) and a very light kind called an axion. Because the ultimate nature of dark matter is not known, it is important to be open to all possibilities.

They found that the detectors they evaluated could find WIMPs for certain ranges of the particle mass. However, when they looked at the axion possibility, it appeared the prospects were even better. Because of its light mass and the manner in which an axion would interact with the detector, the apparatus simply has a better chance of seeing the axion. (If axions exist, of course.)

Experiments with names like ADMX MADMAX and ABRACADABRA are able or will be able to search for the signatures of dark matter proposed in the recent paper. They consist of technologies that are designed to interact with axions in a strong magnetic field and convert them to ordinary microwaves or radio waves that can be easily detected.

It's important to remember that the S1 stream poses no credible threat to the Earth and humanity. There is no need for an action hero to save us. However, the synergy of science is staggering. A careful catalog of nearby stars has opened the prospect of a better possibility of finding and identifying dark matter, which is one of the great unanswered mysteries of modern physics. It's an amazing time we live in, in which we can study such things.

I'm excited. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
If astronomers' calculations are correct, the Solar System is right in the middle of a turbulent space event: a vast 'hurricane' of dark matter, blowing at an insane speed of 500 kilometres per second (310 mps).

We can't see it, and we can't feel it - but it could mean that a direct detection of dark matter is closer than we thought.

Dark matter is one of the big conundrums of the Universe. We have never directly detected it, and we don't know exactly what it even is - but we do know that it's out there. We can infer it based on the motions of the stars and galaxies, which are far too fast for the amount of observable mass.

So there's something else out there, some other mass creating the gravity to influence those cosmic movements. We can even, based on those movements, calculate that invisible mass. "Dark matter" - whatever that might be - is the name we give that mass, and scientists are working on ways to detect it directly.

But we're not there yet. So how do physicists know we're in the middle of a tremendous storm of dark matter? The clue lies in the motion of the stars.

With the release of data from the Gaia satellite last year, astronomers discovered a stellar stream, the dissolving remains left behind by a large dwarf spheroidal galaxy that was eaten by the Milky Way many years ago.

There have been several such streams of stars detected in the Milky Way, but S1, as it is now known, is unusual in that the neighbourhood of the Solar System is smack-bang right in its path of 30,000 stars.

None of them are going to hit us - so you can relax about any fears you might have harboured of fiery stellar death - but it does mean that the dark matter associated with this last shred of the cannibalised dwarf galaxy is moving along with the stream.

Theoretical physicist Ciaran O'Hare from the University of Zaragoza in Spain has led a team of researchers in figuring out the effect of S1 on the dark matter in our little corner of the galaxy.

They looked at different models for the density and distribution of the dark matter flowing in on the S1 stream, and then predicted the dark matter signatures for these models that could be picked up by our detectors here on Earth.

One of these potential signatures is produced by the hypothetical weakly interacting massive particles, known as WIMPs. If these particles exist, we should be able to detect them via their collisions with electrons or atomic nuclei, which would cause charged particles on Earth to recoil, producing light that could be picked up by liquid xenon or crystal detectors.

Based on their calculations, the team determined that these WIMP detectors are unlikely to see any effect from S1, although it's possible that future tech, as it becomes more refined and advanced, could.

Axion detectors - such as the Axion Dark Matter Experiment - have a better chance, they determined. Axions are, again, only hypothetical at this point. If they exist, they are incredibly light, around 500 million times lighter than an electron, and it's possible they are a principal component of cold dark matter.

According to calculations by theoretical physicist Pierre Sikivie, these ultralight particles - which we can't see - could be converted to photons which we can see, in the presence of a strong magnetic field.

"Axion haloscopes possess by far the greatest potential sensitivity to the S1 stream if its dark matter component is sufficiently cold," the researchers wrote in their paper. "Once the axion mass has been discovered, the distinctive velocity distribution of S1 can easily be extracted from the axion power spectrum."

The Axion Dark Matter Experiment, as far as we know, hasn't made an S1 detection either. But knowing what to look for could help scientists improve the chances of this - and if no detection is made, improve detection technology for the ongoing search for dark matter in the future.

The team's research has been published in the journal Physical Review D. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

Tuesday's MegaMillions drawing currently stands at $1.6 billion and Wednesday's lesser Powerball is still no snip at $620 million. There isn't even a promise of alien invasion to cut short the spending window.

But in life, as in fiction, there's always still a catch. Is an overnight windfall of this magnitude really worth the hassle? Earlier this year, a New Hampshire woman sued for the right to retain anonymity while claiming her Powerball prize of $560 million. Most states still consider the identity of lottery winners a matter of public record.

If that sounds like a price worth paying for a half a billion life change, bear in mind the number of lottery winners who've met grisly ends after the news of their winnings spread.

In 2006, Abraham Shakespeare won $30 million in Florida; less than three years later, he was found buried under a concrete slab . Doris "Dee Dee" Moore, a woman who mysteriously befriended Shakespeare after his win, was eventually convicted of his murder . She'd offered to help Shakespeare manage his winnings, and killed him for them instead.

Shakespeare isn't the only winner who's been killed after becoming a high-profile target. In November 2015, Craigory Burch Jr. won $400,000 in Illinois and posed with the check. Two months later, he was killed in a targeted home invasion by gunmen demanding his money.

This is, of course, old wisdom. Chaucer's medieval "Pardoner's Tale" tells the story of three arrogant brothers eager to seek out and destroy Death. When they meet a wizened old man on their journey, so the tale goes, he directs them "to find Death, turn up this crooked way" and points them to a glistening casket of gold buried in the roots of the tree. It only takes this sudden windfall to ensure all three of the brothers kill each other.

Six-hundred years later, J.K. Rowling adapts the tale in the Harry Potter books to tell the story of "the Elder Wand." In this version, Death gifts the eldest of the three brothers an all-powerful magic wand -- but it can't protect him in his sleep. Excited by his new power, he gets drunk in a nearby inn and boasts of his good luck, whereupon he promptly has his throat cut in his drunken sleep by a fellow patron. ("And so Death took the first brother for his own.") Folk knowledge through the ages has warned us: Too much sudden gold or power, and you attract the wrong type of envy.

A woman fills out a Mega Millions lottery ticket on October 19, 2018 in New York City.

Still, who doesn't want to win the lottery? Just keep your mouth shut, do your best to claim anonymity (easier in some states than other) and don't flash your cash, right?

If only it were that simple. Even if you can keep out of the limelight, it's hard to adapt to sudden wealth when you're not used to it. Drug addiction has plagued lottery winners. Jack Whittaker, who won the Powerball in 2002, lost his daughter and granddaughter to drugs and blamed their sudden wealth for fueling their spending on drugs. ("My granddaughter is dead because of the money," Whittaker said in 2007 . "You know, my wife said she wished that she had torn the ticket up. Well, I wish that we tore the ticket up, too.")

Even those born into wealthy families, whose relatives have every opportunity to teach them how to manage money, often screw it up. The last Duke of Marlborough had to put Blenheim Palace, one of Britain's largest stately homes and birthplace of Winston Churchill, into a trust to avoid his ex-convict son from taking control of it. In 1999, citing the Marlborough case, the Duke and Duchess of Northumberland went to court to delay the receipt of an inheritance by their son George, who was 14 years old at the time.

"Too much too young," they argued, would leave him vulnerable to "vices and pitfalls." George Percy has since forged his own career in geothermal energy and will still inherit Alnwick Castle on his parents' death.

But the concerns of parents like the Northumberlands have fueled the rise of "Next Generation" programs in private banks, which specialize in teaching the young how to manage their money sensibly. If you do win this week's Powerball, the best thing you can probably do is sign up to spend a week alongside the world's young aristocrats and oil heirs.

It's sad but true: The best answer given to a fantasy wealth questionnaire in popular culture isn't the hedonism of "Heathers," but the vow of Ross Geller in "Friends" as he snatches a lottery ticket from his friends in season 9: "I'm going to put it all into a very low-yield bond!"

Given that winning $1.6 billion seems like so much trouble, you might consider passing altogether on this week's game of chance. If these horror stories of a "lottery" curse don't put you off, consider the old moral arguments : Lottery tickets are primarily bought in poor neighborhoods, by people who can't afford to throw their money away. Even if your Powerball purchase this week is a one-off flutter, you're still fueling an industry powered by perpetuating gambling addictions.

But if you've really got to play this week, enjoy the thrill. Just cross your fingers, count your lucky stars and pray that you don't win. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

Anyone who needs confirmation of the secret of a strongman -- that he's a weak man, in constant need of ego affirmation -- need only look at images of the Helsinki "summit" between American President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin, which revealed the insecurities of both men underneath the façade of power, and Trump's submissiveness to Putin in particular.

Ruth Ben-Ghiat

Here is a selection of those images captured by photo journalists. Of course, they don't convey every moment of the meeting, but they are consistent with what we saw on air during their appearances together. There are many other such similar images -- each seemingly more awkward than the last -- in which the subjects tell more of a story than they may have wanted through physical cues.

The meeting in Helsinki between two men expert in the art of spectacle intended to intimidate the world, proclaiming that Trump's reorientation of America away from liberal democracy is in line with the intentions of his counterpart Putin.

The images tell another story: one that gives credence to the belief that Trump's allegiance to Putin goes way beyond ideology. We still don't know the actual reason the summit was held, nor do we know -- yet - the nature of the hold Putin has over Trump. Yet photographs suggest that this was no meeting of equals but an encounter between a supplicant (Trump) and a master (Putin), starting with Putin arriving late to their public encounter, setting it about 45 minutes back.

At the same time, Putin, who is used to absolute control, had some discomfort at having their relationship scrutinized by the world's press. He indicated this with small gestures that told a story when captured by photographers.

(CNN) Someday, Donald Trump will become ex-President Trump. After a guilty plea from his longtime "fixer," Michael Cohen, alleging that Trump directed the commission of federal crimes, perhaps that day will arrive sooner rather than later. But whether it's a week, 18 months or more than six years away, we need to start preparing now. That's because, for all of the threat to our democracy Trump poses as president, he may pose an even bigger one as an ex-president.

No one knows how Trump will leave the Oval Office. Maybe he'll resign. Maybe he'll be impeached. Maybe he'll be voted out in November 2020 -- or maybe he'll leave at the end of two terms in January 2025.

But, however he becomes an ex-president, it's impossible to imagine Trump following in Richard Nixon's post-presidency footsteps -- ones that literally traversed empty beaches in a solitary existence. Whether Trump leaves of his own accord after eight years or is abruptly cast out by a vote of the Senate or Electoral College, he is not one to go quietly into the night.

Remember: This is the only presidential candidate in recent memory who refused , even when he appeared to be on the brink of losing the election, to commit to accepting the outcome of the vote. In a career that's careened from real estate to reality TV to politics, there's been one constant: a thirst for more attention.

So imagine ex-President Trump tweeting out real-time commentary on every move his successor makes. Imagine him continuing to fire up crowds at the campaign-style rallies he hasn't stopped doing even as a sitting president. Imagine him starting his own news media empire -- just as he apparently planned to do if he lost in 2016. He will be loud.

And he will be dangerous. Already, Trump is casting doubt on the validity of the upcoming midterm elections, suggesting that Moscow is intervening to favor the Democrats and predicting violence if Democrats reverse Republican gains. Already, Trump is indulging the voices of white supremacism and paranoia, finding moral equivalence "on both sides" in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017, and criticizing tech companies for removing the hate-filled conspiracy theories of Alex Jones and his Infowars. Already, Trump is baselessly attacking other presidents, accusing Barack Obama of surveilling him and planting a spy in his campaign.

Now imagine what Trump will be without White House advisers surrounding him and at least trying to rein him in. Imagine how he might cast doubt on election results, especially ones that have landed him out of office. Imagine how he might seek to rally support wherever he can find it, even among the most extreme voices in our society. Imagine what he might accuse a successor of doing -- especially one who's just beaten him -- given what Trump has said about a predecessor against whom he didn't even run and who went out of his way to be cordial in the transition between them.

And think about Trump's supporters. For many who felt that they didn't have a voice in Washington, Trump was, at last, that voice. They won't want that voice to go silent. That's particularly true if they feel that, just as Trump told them , the system proves "rigged." They'll surely feel that way if Trump's impeached or effectively forced to resign. But, even if he's voted out -- or even if he serves for eight years but claims to have been hamstrung for much of it by a purported "witch hunt" led by special counsel Robert Mueller -- Trump's supporters will feel that they and he never really got a fair shake. And, as he always does, Trump will indulge that view -- indeed, he'll stoke it.

Our nation's thought leaders need to develop and agree to principles now to mitigate the looming threat posed by ex-President Trump. One might apply to the next president, whether Democratic or Republican: Simply do not engage with ex-President Trump, no matter how vicious his attacks become; isolate him by ignoring him.

Another might govern both sides of the aisle in Congress: Speak up loudly for the norm of ex-presidents treating their successors -- and the office itself -- with respect, even if they disagree with particular policies. And a third might guide the media: Make a pact (whether or not the likes of Breitbart and Fox News agree to it) not to give ex-President Trump more than perfunctory coverage, whatever invective he hurls and however the public remains fascinated by his norm-shattering behavior.

From the White House to the Capitol to the media, the dangers posed by ex-President Trump put a premium on electing leaders and supporting commentators who can make a compelling -- even passionate -- case for why fundamental norms of American governance and political dialogue need to be restored and protected.

There will, of course, be more to Trump's post-presidency than the man himself: He has introduced ideas that will not simply vanish when he leaves the White House. Some of those ideas concern how presidents (and even presidential candidates) communicate, such as by interrupting and talking over debate opponents as well as by using language -- like Trump's reference to "s**thole countries" -- previously unacceptable in mainstream politics or even society.

Some of those ideas relate to particular policies, from Trump's brand of economic nationalism to his insistence that immigration is predominantly a liability for the United States, its security and its identity. No matter how Trump leaves office, those ideas have now been normalized in ways that defy instant reversal. They will need to be addressed by deliberate norm-restoring behavior by future presidents and by the articulation of superior policies by politicians able to make those policies resonate with the public.

Whatever traction Trump's ideas have, Trump himself will surely cling to the spotlight -- if he can. We were, as a nation, largely blindsided by the assault on longstanding norms that Trump has personified. That's allowed a lot of damage to be done that we'll spend decades repairing. We can't afford to be blindsided, yet again, by the potential for ex-President Trump to shatter more norms and continue to shake the foundations of our democracy. That's what those ousted from power do in banana republics. Let's get the principles in place to ensure it doesn't happen here. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
(CNN) Michael Cohen, President Donald Trump's former personal attorney, pleaded guilty in Manhattan federal court Tuesday to eight criminal counts and implicated Trump himself in a remarkable courtroom moment.

Cohen admitted that "in coordination and at the direction of a candidate for federal office," he kept information that would have harmed Trump from becoming public during the 2016 election cycle.

The charges against Cohen, an attorney for Trump until earlier this year and a member of his inner circle throughout his presidential campaign, bring a climactic end to a months-long investigation by the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York. And they expose, through the criminal information filed against Cohen in court, that he acted with Trump and his allies, including David Pecker, the CEO of the National Enquirer's publisher, American Media Inc., to suppress potentially damaging claims against the now-President.

The dramatic conclusion to the investigation into Cohen launches a fresh round of questions about Trump's actions. Though Trump himself isn't named, the court filing refers to an Individual-1, who by January 2017 had become president of the United States.

The counts against Cohen included tax fraud, false statements to a bank and campaign finance violations tied to his work for Trump, including payments Cohen made or helped orchestrate that were designed to silence women who claimed affairs with the then-candidate.

Though not named in the plea deal filed in court, the women whom Cohen helped silence were two who have since gone public with their claims of sexual encounters or affairs with Trump: a porn star named Stephanie Clifford, who goes by the stage name Stormy Daniels, and a former Playboy model named Karen McDougal. Trump has denied the claims.

In the case of Clifford, Cohen arranged a nondisclosure agreement for which he paid her $130,000, and for that Cohen was charged with making an excessive campaign contribution, since the payment was made in service of the campaign and exceeded the federal limit.

For McDougal, Cohen and the CEO of a media company "worked together to keep an individual from publicly disclosing" information that would have been harmful to a candidate, saying the individual received $150,000. In the summer of 2016, American Media Inc. paid McDougal $150,000 for a contract that effectively silenced her claims of an affair with Trump.

"In or about August 2015, the Chairman and Chief Executive of Corporation-1 ("Chairman-1"), in coordination with MICHAEL COHEN, the defendant, and one or more members of the campaign, offered to help deal with negative stories about Individual-l's relationships with women by, among other things, assisting the campaign in identifying such stories so they could be purchased and their publication avoided," the criminal information says. "Chairman-1 agreed to keep COHEN apprised of any such negative stories."

Though the corporation and its chairman are not named, court filings describe the corporation as "a media company that owns, among other things, a popular tabloid magazine."

A spokesman for AMI didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.

The court filings also link AMI to Clifford, saying that in October 2016, an agent for an adult film actress contacted the company and said she was willing to go public with her allegations of an affair with Trump. Pecker then contacted Cohen, and Cohen negotiated with the woman's attorney to "purchase [her] silence" for $130,000.

After Cohen failed to either execute the agreement immediately or pay the woman, she threatened, in late October -- 14 days before the election -- to Pecker to take her story to another publication. Pecker then informed Cohen, in part by calling him on an encrypted phone app. He told Cohen that the deal needed to be completed "or it could look awfully bad for everyone," according to court filings. Cohen then agreed to make the payment and finalize the deal.

Appearing in court on Tuesday, Cohen said of the charge linked to McDougal that it was done "for the principal purpose of influencing the election." Regarding the charge linked to Clifford, Cohen said the money "was later repaid to me by the candidate."

Assistant US Attorney Andrea Griswold said prosecutors would have been prepared to present evidence during a trial that these were so-called hush payments.

"The proof on these counts at trial would establish that these payments were made in order to ensure that each recipient of the payments did not publicize their stories of alleged affairs with the candidate," she said.

Cohen faces up to 65 years in prison.

Judge William H. Pauley set a sentencing date for Cohen for December 12. The judge set a $500,000 bond, which must be co-signed by Cohen's wife and another party.

When checking if he was of sound mind, Pauley asked Cohen whether he had consumed alcohol. Cohen replied that he had some alcohol with dinner the previous evening -- a glass of Glenlivet 12, on the rocks.

The charges against Cohen also covered a range of his activity outside of his work for Trump. In the tax evasion scheme linked to his taxi medallion business, Cohen failed to report more than $4 million in income, according to the criminal information filed against him, resulting in his avoidance of more than $1.4 million in taxes he would have had to owe the Internal Revenue Service.

Cohen also pleaded guilty to making false statements to a bank by understating his medallion debt in order to secure loans to buy property. He had omitted a $14 million line of credit on applications so that he could purchase properties, including a Park Avenue condominium and a summer home. He also got a $500,000 home equity line of credit in April 2016, a loan he never would have gotten if the bank knew of the $14 million debt, the court filings say.

Shortly after 4 p.m. on Tuesday, after having surrendered to the FBI, Cohen entered court in a dark suit, white shirt and gold tie, followed moments later by his attorney, Guy Petrillo.

Also in attendance to observe Cohen's guilty plea in court were Deputy US Attorney Robert Khuzami and the public corruption chief for the Southern District of New York.

"These are very serious charges that reflect a pattern of lies and dishonesty," Khuzami said outside the courthouse following the proceedings. "They are significant in their own right. They are particularly significant when done by a lawyer."

By pleading guilty, both Cohen and prosecutors avoid the spectacle and uncertainty of a trial. But the plea deal is a significant blow for Trump, as Cohen was part of Trump's inner circle for more than a decade, working as his personal attorney at the Trump Organization and continuing to advise the President after the election. Cohen once said he would take a bullet for Trump, but the relationship between the two men has frayed since an FBI raid in April of Cohen's office, hotel room and home.

In turn, Trump has distanced himself from Cohen, who has told friends he has felt isolated, according to the friends . Last month, Cohen told ABC News his loyalty is to his family and country first, not the President.

The Cohen investigation was referred to the Southern District of New York by special counsel Robert Mueller. The plea deal does not include cooperation by Cohen, and it is unclear if he will follow through on his previous assertion to friends , according to sources, that he is willing to talk to Mueller.

It's not clear how the plea deal with Cohen might affect other entities that have been under scrutiny by federal prosecutors as part of the Cohen investigation, including AMI or Pecker.

In the first of a series of weekly columns (available soon as a newsletter), we're looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets.

(CNN) After the two had had their say, the millions had theirs. A wrenching day of testimony by Christine Blasey Ford and Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh over her claim that he had once sexually assaulted her (which he denies) set off a global torrent of reaction. It would continue even after a stunning twist Friday stalled what had seemed a march to confirmation.

By then, on social media, stories from women had piled up behind a heartbreaking hashtag, #whyIdidntreport, which became a spontaneous national repository of revelation and regret.

Meanwhile, pundits, politicians and regular citizens tore into a "broken" confirmation process that recalled the Anita Hill case and had turned into a "partisan circus." Julian Zelizer summoned Hill's ordeal to argue that the nickel never dropped for the GOP. The "joke" of the Senate's investigation of the Kavanaugh case, he said, reveals a nation whose "politics are in a worse place than they were 27 years ago."

And on Thursday evening the white Republican men who control the Senate Judiciary Committee delivered their verdict: a vote to forward Kavanaugh's nomination to the full Senate. While no surprise, this was for many women (and men) another patriarchal punch in the gut. For others? A vindication.

about 12 hours earlier "to allow senators to hear the public's voice." Then two women cornered swing vote Jeff Flake on an elevator, delivered their own stories of assault, and by the end of Friday President Donald Trump had ordered a weeklong FBI probe of his nominee—a pause, that David Gergen had suggested about 12 hours earlier "to allow senators to hear the public's voice."

Flake's belated attempt to put the brakes on Kavanaugh's confirmation drew only a half-hearted cheer from Noah Berlatsky, who said it was only "the bare minimum to even approach decency." Still, it's not nothing, he wrote: "Dissension among Republicans in power can signal GOP partisans that it's okay to take positions against Trump or against McConnell."

Did we mention that Bill Cosby was sentenced to prison this week for sexual assault?

We can't remember when our contributors had so much to say.

Frida Ghitis saw a dire signal from Republicans after Christine Blasey Ford's riveting, credible testimony. In the midst of #MeToo, she said, the party is "actively standing against efforts to repair one of the longstanding injustices in society: the attitude that allows men to exploit and abuse women."

On several occasions, he was belligerent."

Defense attorney Page Pate said Blasey Ford "nailed it," which was why it was such a bad look for the committee's Republicans to have their chosen prosecutor, Rachel Mitchell, suddenly stop her questioning of the sobbing nominee. They dropped her "like a hot potato when it came time to really confront Judge Kavanaugh about these allegations."

Kavanaugh's repeated crying as he defended himself before senators, wrote Michael D'Antonio, showed the "wider latitude" for emoting that men in politics have today (he noted that a woman acting the same way would have been called "hysterical.") Kavanaugh had a right to despair, observed Scott Jennings, and "deserves credit for fighting like hell to defend his honor, his reputation and the family name carried by his wife and daughters."

The well-worn "good wife" trope sends a message (as it did for Bill Clinton and Clarence Thomas): "if the wife and family are the injured parties, the woman who has brought forth the charge is understood as victimizing a woman and children too."

When Bill Cosby was sentenced to prison Tuesday after years of sexual assault allegations, some of his defenders said he was a black man who was set up. Are you kidding? wrote Kyra Kiles in the Grio . Instead of martyring a predator they should use their energy to help, not silence, victims for "a stranger they 'know' only from behind the warm glow of a TV screen."

The Independent's Kuba Shand-Baptiste wrote that a reluctant Hollywood Chamber of Commerce needs to scrub Cosby's star from the "Walk of Fame": "To suggest that his legacy, and not the people he hurt through it, deserves special protection beggars belief."

Was laughing at Trump's UN General Assembly comment really such a good idea? World leaders lost it when President Trump proclaimed that "my administration has accomplished more than almost any administration in the history of our country" -- and Nic Robertson has a warning for delegates who joined in: "Hope you don't get found out. President Trump likes respect. He won't forget. And he may get the last laugh."

In any case, his speech was aimed squarely at voters back home, wrote David Andelman. It was a hard sell for "America first" and a hard slam at Iran. The world should worry, Andelman wrote: "Trump's defiant messaging -- given Iran's steadfast adherence to a nuclear deal that the United States wants desperately to kill -- is powerful evidence" that he is hurtling the globe toward nuclear proliferation.

Next chapter?

As we head into a new week of Kavanaugh, expect the pending FBI investigation to hang heavy in the air. James Gagliano says leave it to "Carla F. Bad."

Who's she? "Well, 'she' is the readily memorized acronym that reminds investigators of just what to investigate when looking into someone's background. It is an enduring checklist that the FBI utilizes to assess honesty and trustworthiness in someone holding, or seeking to hold, a position of trust in our republic," he writes.

"The acronym represents character, associates, reputation, loyalty, ability, finances, bias, alcohol and drugs. It was presumably employed during Judge Kavanaugh's multiple background investigations during his tenure in the Bush 43 White House, and when he was appointed a federal appeals judge in 2006."

Let's hear what Carla says.

(CNN) As America approaches the end of Donald Trump's first year as President , one point on which the entire country can agree is that this has been a year like no other in the nation's history. If the polls are to be believed, most of us see Trump's presidency so far as a slow-motion calamity.

And yet, not every development in the last year has been negative. The Trump presidency has energized the country and given it a new mood of seriousness.

It has reminded America about its priorities and caused its people to ponder important questions. Even if he has done so unwittingly, we can thank President Trump for bringing some exciting changes to the country. Here are five of Donald Trump's greatest unintentional accomplishments.

Sparking the women's movement and a conversation about decency

It all started before he came into office, when voters heard and saw how he talked to and about women. We heard the women who accused him of sexual harassment; we saw how he disparaged women on the campaign trail ; and we saw that he became President in spite of it all.

On the day after the inauguration, millions of women took to the streets around the world to make it clear that women would not sit back and watch Trump's style become the new normal. The women's march became likely the largest single day demonstration in US history.

JUST WATCHED The year feminism fought back Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH The year feminism fought back 05:04

And that was just the beginning. As the backlash against sexism has continued, courageous women revealed the extent of abuse they have experienced in all facets of life. The #MeToo movement took down some of the most prominent figures in journalism, entertainment, politics and elsewhere. And the tsunami against abuse is still raging.

It's no wonder "feminism" is Merriam-Webster's word of the year, its most searched term.

And the best is still to come.

The next elections should bring a tide of women to public office. EMILY's List, the group that helps women political candidates, reportedly says last year it had heard from about 1,000 women interested in getting its support. This year, the number skyrocketed to 22,000

Killing apathy

Trump's presidency has electrified the country, creating a sense of energy and urgency unlike anything the United States had seen in at least a generation. Today, even people who routinely muttered, "I hate politics," and stayed uninvolved, are bristling with political thoughts and following the latest news about Trump's legislative agenda, the Russia investigation, and matters as obscure as the gap between what Trump says and what his secretary of state argues.

Americans have discovered that political apathy is a luxury better left to people living in countries where they trust their government.

Raising the question: What really makes America great?

As soon as he took office, Trump started trying to enact the agenda that he claimed would Make America Great Again. But to millions of Americans, Trump's agenda and rhetoric seemed to highlight precisely the opposite.

Trump forced many who had not given the matter much thought to consider what exactly it is that makes America great: its pursuit of ideals such as respect for the individual, for a free press, for equality; and the sacred notion of "rule of law," that no individual, however powerful, stands above the law or should wield his power to interfere with justice.

Trump helped us understand the difference between patriotism and nationalism. Patriotism is love for one's country. It compels us to protect those characteristics that make it worth loving, and to strive to bring the country closer to its ideals. Nationalism, on the other hand, is what Trump preaches in his MAGA creed. It is an attitude of superiority, tainted with notions of ethnic and religious supremacy.

Reinvigorating journalism

When historians look back at the Trump era, they will note that Trump spawned a golden age of journalism. Even as Trump declared war on the media, casting doubt on any piece of news he found unflattering by calling it "fake news," serious journalists went to work with more determination than ever.

Sure, journalists made mistakes, and when discovered, they were promptly corrected. That stands in sharp contrast to Trump's avalanche of lies. By The New York Times' count, Trump has told nearly six times as many falsehoods in 10 months than Barack Obama told in eight years as President. Trump succeeded in confusing the public and blurring reality. It was all in keeping with his gaslighting technique . But the reality-based media fought back with facts and with in-depth reporting that brought Americans history-changing truths.

Giving satire a shot in the arm

While Trump made Americans more serious, he also made comedians much funnier. Political humor blossomed like never before. Observers noted that the President himself hardly ever laughs unless in the company of adoring crowds, with his sense of humor limited to mocks and insults.

But for professional humorists, Trump was a godsend. The bittersweet cracks propelled the ruthlessly brilliant Stephen Colbert to new levels of hilarity, and the more Trump-centered his jokes became, the higher his ratings climbed.

So, you see, it hasn't all been bad. Perhaps Vladimir Putin is right when he says Trump has made significant achievements. Although, this is probably not what Putin or what Trump has in mind when he falsely claims he has accomplished more than any of his predecessors.

It's more along the lines of Colbert's comment after Roy Moore lost the election in Alabama, when he said , "I'm a little shaky ... due to a condition my doctor calls 'hope.'"

These are at least five achievements from the Trump administration that can give Americans that same hope. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
(CNN) In a year dominated by the beginning of the Trump presidency, readers came to CNN Opinion looking for insight into the man occupying the highest office in the land. But Donald Trump's many actions and tweets weren't the only subjects of interest. Stories of racism and white supremacist groups, workplace sexual harassment, freedom of the press and a series of horrific natural disasters attracted your attention, too.

Here are excerpts from a selection of some of the most popular opinion pieces of 2017.

David Axelrod: I woke up this morning as an alternative fact

January 31

I woke up this morning as an alternative fact.

In justifying the appointment of Steve Bannon, the President's chief strategist, to the National Security Council, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer cited my role in the Obama White House as a precedent. Spicer said press secretary Robert Gibbs and I attended classified National Security Council meetings "all the time."

That is simply not true.

As a senior adviser to President Obama in 2009, I had the opportunity to witness the fateful deliberations of his National Security Council Principals committee over the strategy the United States would pursue in the war with al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

I was not a member of the committee. I did not speak or participate. I sat on the sidelines as a silent observer with Gibbs because we would be called upon to publicly discuss the President's decision on that critical matter and the process by which he arrived at it.

Dean Obeidallah: Donald Trump's most bone-chilling tweet

February 6

Dean Obeidallah

Here is Trump's truly jaw-dropping tweet from Saturday morning: "The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned!"

Why is this so concerning? It's OK to argue about whether the judge should or shouldn't have issued this order. But Trump is apparently attempting to delegitimize our federal judiciary by calling Judge James Robart, a George W. Bush-appointed judge, a "so-called" judge while arguing that his decision is "ridiculous."

Let's be blunt, because the stakes demand it: An independent federal judiciary is our last, best hope at preventing Trump from violating the US Constitution and illegally grabbing power. And Trump has to understand that, hence his attempt to undermine it.

George Takei: On this Remembrance Day, I hear terrible echoes of the past

February 19

George Takei

I was just a child of 5 when soldiers marched up our driveway in a Los Angeles residential neighborhood, bayonets in hand, and pounded on our front door, ordering us out. We were permitted only what we could carry, no bedding, no pets.

I remember my mother's tears as she and our father gathered us up, with our precious few belongings in hand. She was determined to bring a sewing machine, fearful that we would need to make or mend clothes where we were headed. She wasn't sure the authorities would allow her to take that Singer machine, so she kept it a secret, even from us. She managed, however, to pack a few treats for us children for the long journey ahead.

That was in 1942. Earlier that year, on February 19, 75 years ago yesterday, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order, No. 9066, which set the internment into motion.

Peter Bergen: Why the 'mother of all bombs' and why now?

April 13

Peter Bergen

The dropping of a "mother of all bombs" Thursday by the United States on an ISIS cave and bunker complex in Achin district in eastern Afghanistan should be understood as part of an effort to reverse a war that is not going well for the Afghan government and, by extension, the United States.

The non-nuclear 21,600-pound GBU-43/B Massive Ordnance Air Blast Bomb (MOAB) "targeted a system of tunnels and caves that ISIS fighters use to move around freely," White House press secretary Sean Spicer said.

Thursday's bombing had a feeling of deja vu. A decade and a half ago the US Air Force dropped massive 15,000 pound "Daisy Cutter" bombs on the Tora Bora complex where Osama bin Laden was hiding in December 2001. Achin district is only a dozen or so miles from the Tora Bora region.

Nikki Haley: An unprecedented step on human rights

April 19

Nikki Haley

The Syrian war is just one example of how human rights violations can become a vicious cycle of violence and instability that quickly spirals into all-out war. What began as an act of free expression of the kind Americans take for granted has become a conflict responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of desperate refugees. Nations thousands of miles away have been impacted.

As the US ambassador to the United Nations, I've looked at how we can do more to respond to human rights violations before they reach the level of conflict. Traditionally, the United Nations Security Council has been considered the place where peace and security are debated, not human rights. But Tuesday, at the insistence of the United States, for the first time the Security Council took up the connection between human rights and conflict. We debated how widespread human rights violations are a warning sign -- a loud, blaring siren -- that a breakdown in peace and security is coming.

Sarah Lenti: Single, childless and nearing 40, I saw one real option

April 25

Sarah Lenti

It was a year ago when a young woman stopped me in a neighborhood shop. She gazed at my stroller and started crying. She told me how lucky I was to be married with kids.

My heart dropped. She didn't know me at all.

I am a single mother by choice. Yet I was raised in a Christian, conservative home, where I grew up believing in the traditional family unit. And I was taught that there was an order to achieving it. First, fall in love. Second, marry a man. Third, start a family.

Now in my fifth decade, only one has proven true for me -- and it isn't the first.

John McWhorter: A man who is tragically unfit to be president

May 2

John McWhorter

When President Donald Trump revealed that he doesn't know why the Civil War was fought, or at least figures it could have been averted by the kind of deal-making he supposedly excels at, it was revealing in ways beyond the ones easy to glean.

The ignorance is, as usual, stunning for someone in the public spotlight. "People don't ask that question, but why was there the Civil War?" Trump asks rhetorically, which is like saying no one has bothered to study anatomy or physics.

Yet this sort of thing should no longer surprise us from this man. He doesn't read and lacks curiosity, but that's hardly rare among human beings. A college teacher friend of mine the other day noted that no one in his class could name who was president in the 1980s, nor, upon being told who it was, could they name his political party. People like this don't mysteriously develop an interest in civics after college. Sometimes they become president.

Michael D'Antonio: The little boy president

May 16

Michael D'Antonio

Like most little boys, Donald Trump can be disarmingly honest, as when he once said, "When I look at myself in the first grade and I look at myself now, I'm basically the same. The temperament is not that different." The trouble is that the first grader is now President of the United States, and his temperament is on display for the world to see.

Unpredictable, impulsive and immature, Trump acts in a way that would be expected of a 6-year-old boy, but is terrifying in a man whose moods dictate decisions carried out by adults on behalf of the most powerful nation in the world.

Trump's dismissal of FBI Director James Comey offers a sterling example of the childish -- and reckless -- Trump style. When Comey broke with bureau tradition and spoke negatively about Trump's rival in the election, though initially he was criticized by candidate Trump, he was later praised -- and effusively. Over and over again, the soon-to-be-president described how Comey had done the right thing in criticizing Hillary Clinton. Comey remained in Trump's good graces after he was inaugurated, and Trump's team expressed confidence in him up until last week.

Anushay Hossain: The ugly truth behind Saudi Arabia's love for Melania Trump

May 23

Anushay Hossain

Donald Trump's first major trip overseas may be fraught with diplomatic land mines for the President, but the Trump administration can at least comfort itself with the clear hit that Melania Trump has been with the Saudi press.

The fact that Melania is communicating with the media and the public in Saudi Arabia -- mainly through what Saudi news reports have deemed her "classy and conservative" fashion choices -- works well in the notoriously anti-woman kingdom. Her intense appeal makes sense, considering the first lady represents so much that Saudi citizens find familiar and can relate to, especially visually. Melania walks behind her husband, is quiet and reserved, does not make obvious demands (at least not ones we can hear), and most importantly, she looks beautiful and polished...

In Melania, the Saudi press and the Saudi government found the perfect spokeswoman, who projects a glamorous image that glosses over one of world's most autocratic and oppressive regimes.

Gloria Borger: Trump, home all alone

May 30

Gloria Borger

So Trump returns to the White House this week just as he left -- lonely, angry and not happy with much of anyone. The presidency, Donald Trump is discovering, is not an easy or natural fit.

"He now lives within himself, which is a dangerous place for Donald Trump to be," says someone who speaks with the President. "I see him emotionally withdrawing. He's gained weight. He doesn't have anybody whom he trusts."

The question, he adds, is whether Trump will understand the enormity of what he faces or will instead "be back to being arrogant and stubborn." He will have to realize that "all this trip really did was hit the pause button."

Douglas Heye: After baseball attack, the hate in politics has got to go

June 14

Douglas Heye

Politics is a business with a lot of tough talk where contrasts and distinctions are constantly drawn. Negative ads have become an art form. But what we've seen in recent years is different. Increasingly, we question not just the judgment of those we disagree with, but each others' motives and legitimacy.

On the far ends of the political spectrum, invective and hate -- or a blind "us versus them" tribal mentality -- stand above reason and debate. Those voices gain prominence and followers as the media incentivize them to go further by giving them airtime and clicks.

Our nation faces many challenges, but healing our divisions may be our biggest one. More than Obamacare, tax reform, ISIS or our national debt, this rhetoric, and the divisions it causes, directly constrains our ability to tackle other issues.

We know what we will do today. We will pray and we will come together. But what we do tomorrow is even more important.

John Kirby: Here's what we're sure of in the USS Fitzgerald collision

June 17

John Kirby

First, we know the crew fought heroically to save their ship and the lives of their shipmates. We know that from early reports by Navy officials but also from the images that flashed across our screens, our tablets and our phones after the incident happened early Saturday.

One look at the crushed, twisted starboard side, the hoses flaked about, the water being discharged, the frantic work being done tells you all you need to know about the stuff you can't see in those same images: a fiercely brave crew working together to staunch the flooding, to rescue their shipmates and to save their ship.

You can be certain they ended up drenched, exhausted, scraped and bruised -- but not broken. They kept that ship from foundering for 16 brutal hours. And they brought her back into port.

Jen Psaki: Putin set a trap and Trump fell into it

July 7

Jen Psaki

The Russians just played the President. It was predictable. And he let it happen.

On paper, Vladimir Putin should not have had the upper hand going into the meeting.

To start with, Russia has been living with sanctions put in place more than three years ago because of its annexation of Crimea.

And most Americans, save a few people including the President of the United States, are confident that Putin led the Russian intervention into the American election and into many other elections around the world.

President Obama booted out nearly three dozen spies in December and closed two compounds, and there are many, from both parties, calling for an additional round of sanctions on Russia.

We should have had some leverage. So what happened?

Jane Carr: What the white supremacist view of history leaves out

August 18

Jane Greenway Carr

The white supremacists in Charlottesville said they wanted to "defend history" by protesting efforts to take down Confederate monuments. They say they feel threatened. They fear the removal of "white stories" from our culture.

I used to teach African-American literature and cultural history. I wish I could tell them what real erasure looks like. I'd ask them to think about the memorials that never existed in public spaces in the South -- noting Richmond's past as a slave market, or the communities of free blacks who were terrorized by the installation of these Confederate monuments in the first place. To take down Charlottesville's statue of Robert E. Lee will not change the fact that all Virginia schoolchildren know his name, while the names of those who lived in the lost Charlottesville neighborhood of Vinegar Hill are forgotten.

I keep returning to the question: How can people who claim to love history get the meaning of history so very, very wrong?

Lev Golinkin: Jared and Ivanka are failing a basic moral test

August 19

Lev Golinkin

But the silence emanating from Jared and Ivanka was exponentially more powerful than any I'd heard before. To me, as a Jew, seeing nothing but two tweets from Ivanka brought the kind of pain I'm sure is echoed by African-Americans anytime Ben Carson defends the President, and Asian-Americans in the wake of Elaine Chao's and Nikki Haley's equivocations: condemning hate in general terms while carefully avoiding criticizing the very administration they're part of.

No press conference was forthcoming, no rejection of Donald Trump's words; there was no statement from Jared about the horror his grandparents had survived; nothing from Ivanka, who had spoken about standing up for mothers on the campaign trail, about defending today's Jewish children -- her children; indeed all children -- from intimidation and violence. There was nothing, but the sound of steady clicking on Ivanka's electronic device as she wrote two tweets.

It was like listening to the fabric of Judaism tear at itself.

Peniel Joseph: Can 'I Have a Dream' help us heal after Charlottesville?

August 26

Peniel Joseph

Fifty-four years later, King's legacy offers concrete ways of dealing with a contemporary racial landscape that has produced a sense of vertigo in large swaths of the American public. King's words remain a singular anchor for all those who believe in freedom; by speaking truth to power in a political climate more racially toxic than our own, King did more than dream about racial justice.

He challenged all of us to embrace a vision of a liberated future capable of touching individual hearts and minds as it traversed through the blood and veins of the body politic, on the way to creating a nation as good as the best of its citizens.

Alice Stewart: What Trump got right in Texas

August 30

Alice Stewart

Hurricane Harvey is historic, not just in its size and scope, but in its significance as Donald Trump's first natural disaster test as President. His "darned if you do, darned if you don't" decision to visit South Texas on Tuesday, away from the rescue efforts, was the right call. Trump is demonstrating he has the compassion and commitment to meet the needs of victims of the deadly storm.

Critics blasted Trump for not meeting with victims directly to offer his personal condolences. Look, there's plenty of time for the powerful photos showing comfort, but now is the time for action -- not optics. These people are in the rescue and recovery mode, which can only be hampered by the distraction of a presidential visit. They need homes, not hugs; they need structure, not selfies, and they need funds, not a presidential flyover.

Unfortunately, every president has been forced to lead this country through natural or man-made disasters and faced the challenges of serving as consoler in chief: President Barack Obama had the Charleston, South Carolina, shootings; President George W. Bush had 9/11; President Bill Clinton met the challenge after the Oklahoma City bombing. All rose to the occasion.

Likewise, Trump is stepping up to the challenge, reassuring storm victims that resources are on the way.

LaQuishe Wright: Harvey survivor: The loss is hitting me in waves

September 1

LaQuishe Wright

I woke up Friday morning and looked outside at a deceptively beautiful day. Beautiful because my two sons, Bry and Ryan, two dogs and I are safe and dry and the sun is shining again after days of endless rain. Deceptive because our entire life as we know it is submerged in 4 feet of water less than 20 minutes away.

To experience devastation like that brought by Hurricane Harvey feels very different from what you've probably seen on television. I was lucky enough to make it out of my house in Katy with my kids, my dogs, our cars and at least some of our belongings and memories. My neighbors' harrowing evacuations make me feel even luckier to have made it out safely, but I can't help but be concerned about what comes next for us.

Brooke Baldwin: Speaking like this to women in 2017? No way

September 18

Brooke Baldwin

The newsroom around me fell silent. I was staring into the camera trying to make sense of what was unfolding on live television. I even caught my cameraman Jay's eyes in disbelief. I thought again: "It is 2017, and this grown man is on my show talking with me -- a female host -- about boobs. Is this seriously happening?"

And then I did something I've done only a handful of times in my career. I told the control room to kill his mic and said "bye." I invite a variety of people on my show with wide-ranging opinions -- sometimes even my jaw hits the floor, too -- but I let them speak. Whether it's left, right or center -- I want to expose my viewers to other perspectives. Agree with them or not, the nation needs to listen.

But this ... was different.

Eleanor McManus, Why I'm speaking up about Mark Halperin

October 26

Eleanor McManus

Fast forward several months later to when I graduated and asked for an informational meeting. I reached out to Mr. Halperin and he asked me to come see him. I was thrilled that someone from ABC News was willing to meet with me -- perhaps that was my way in the door. It was my first official meeting; I even had to buy a suit for the occasion.

I don't quite remember what we talked about, but I do remember him asking me to sit down next to him on the couch. I thought it was awkward to sit on the couch when I was perfectly comfortable sitting in the chair across from his desk. But I complied, and I also remember him sitting a little too close to me...

I'm telling my story publicly now because I hope that when this happens again to another young woman, and it will, she will not be so courteous and apologetic. I'm hoping women today will finally speak out in real time -- when this behavior happens. Women cannot stay silent for fear it will damage their careers, because that only allows the aggressor to continue his behavior with other women.

Marvin Washington: Kneeling isn't about patriotism -- it's a distress signal

October 14

Marvin Washington

I spent 10 years playing in the NFL, won a Super Bowl and have been blessed beyond imagination -- in no small part because of the best fans in professional sports -- fans of multiple races, genders, religions and political persuasions.

I'm not confused about the role the fans played in my success and neither are the current players in the league. I understand that many NFL fans on both sides feel strongly about the National Anthem protests and the issues of race that underlie them -- so do I and so do the current players. I am an African-American who grew up in the 1960s and the vitriol that surged two Fridays ago, stoked by a speech delivered in Alabama no less, is eerily reminiscent for me of that dark time in our history.

Some players had been engaging in periodic protest long before President Donald Trump's fateful rally, but it's also fair to say this wasn't top of mind for most people before that rally. Trump suggested (mostly white) owners should fire any of the (mostly black) players on their teams who engaged in protest during the National Anthem, and he called them a profane name.

The protests, begun by former NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick and now being carried on by current players, are not about patriotism -- they are about systemic racial inequality in the criminal justice system. They are about how communities of color are policed -- problems that experts on both sides agree on.

Nicole Stamp: What decent men can do in response to #MeToo

October 21

Nicole Stamp

8. Don't use gendered or misogynist insults. Words like bitch, cunt, or slut only target women. Sissy, fairy and cuck demean feminine traits as lesser, weak and undesirable in men. Avoid those words. If you must insult someone, focus on their actions, not their body or their gender.

9. Free kids from rigid gender roles. For boys and young men, you can role-model that activities and traits traditionally coded as "feminine" are valuable. Challenge dismissive ideas around what counts as "girl stuff." Delight in stories with strong female characters. Give a toddler boy a baby doll and praise his gentleness. Race trucks with a little girl. Give kids the tools and confidence to challenge and defy gender stereotypes.

10. Don't focus on little girls' looks. Many people's first interaction with a young girl is to compliment her cuteness, prettiness or clothing. But this tells her -- and any boys nearby -- that beauty is her most interesting trait. Instead, ask little girls engaging, gender-neutral questions, like "What kind of toy is that? What subjects do you like in school? What's your favorite animal? Hey, what are you reading?" There are so many things to talk about.

Brianna Keilar: With my husband deployed, covering the news hits home

October 25

Brianna Keilar

The last few days the news has been dominated by a controversy over Trump's call to Myeshia Johnson, a Gold Star widow. She is just 24 years old and pregnant with her third child, mourning her husband, Army Sgt. La David Johnson, who was killed in an ISIS ambush in Niger. ...

Moments of dignity and solemnity have been interrupted over and over by politics and vitriol and today, it seems, is no different.

I turn the television off and retweet the President's tweet, commenting, "As I'm watching 'Taking Chance' this tweet alerts on my phone. And that about sums up this week for me."

A few minutes later a man tweets at me: "It's telling that you are only now watching this. Been out for years. More evidence U and other media R in a bubble & don't know real people."

I just can't let it go.

"My husband is on his sixth deployment right now. You don't know anything about me," I reply.

Mr. Trump, please stop it. Please stop!

Think of what Sgt. Johnson would want. You are putting his widow in the terrible position of having to fight for her dignity when she should be concentrating on taking care of herself, her health, her two children, and the one on the way.

Listen to what Myeshia Johnson said this morning in an interview on ABC.

"The President said that he knew what he signed up for but it hurts anyways and I was -- it made me cry because I was very angry at the tone of his voice and how he said it. He couldn't remember my husband's name. The only way he remembered my husband's name because he told me he had my husband's report in front of him and that's when he actually said La David."

I know you have children -- and two daughters.

Mel Robbins: Why Americans don't give a damn about mass shootings

November 6

Mel Robbins

One month ago, the worst mass shooting in US history took place at a country music concert in Las Vegas. Fifty-eight people were killed and more than 500 people injured. Bill O'Reilly boiled the massacre down to six words: "This is the price of freedom."

I hate to say it, but he is right. Sunday, just 34 days after Vegas, 26 people were gunned down and about 20 others were wounded during a church service in Texas. And here's what is really sick -- we won't be surprised when there's another mass shooting next month. Maybe it'll be your church, your mall, your concert or your movie theater. That's the price of freedom.

In America, we are free to stockpile weapons. We are free to order ammo online. We are free to outfit our guns with bump stocks, like the Vegas shooter did. This is the price we pay for freedom, alright. The freedom to not give a damn.

Jessica Barth: We could have made Weinstein powerless

November 9

Jessica Barth

It has taken me a few days to process the sudden explosion of allegations of sexual harassment, abuse and assault made against Harvey Weinstein. Each woman who steps forward leaves me with a mixture of emotions. On the one hand, I feel an overwhelming sense of relief and pride when I see women joining together to share their stories. On the other, I experience a sense of horror over the staggering number of accusers. Women stripped of their power, silenced and shamed.

I was one of them and recounted my own experience publicly last week.

In my own experiences with sexual harassment and assault, I have been made to feel as if I had to compromise my own convictions for the advancement of my career. I was made to believe that my talent and experience should take a back seat to my physical appearance. I was manipulated into believing I had "asked for it." And I was made to feel that if I spoke out or fought back, the repercussions would make me regret it.

Ann Moses: I watched fame take its toll on young David Cassidy

November 22

Ann Moses

When he got the "Partridge" gig, David was barely 20, and had very little life experience. He also had little or no support system when he became an overnight sensation. I watched it all happen, and later saw it all unravel, as I spent several days a week on the Partridge set, covering David and his co-stars, real-life stepmom Shirley Jones and Susan Dey.

At first, David was giddy to be appearing on a prime-time television series. He was cheerful and cooperative, which made my job easier as I worked every angle to come up with stories about this shiny-haired young man. ...

A few months later, the nice young man who'd kissed my mom on the cheek in thanks for looking after his puppies was pretty much gone. Whenever I appeared on set, David began to disappear between scenes -- during the times he had once joined me for interviews. I couldn't write about David's favorite snack food (dry-roasted peanuts) or his favorite color ("It depends on my mood") or how he felt about his neat new sports car if he was hiding from me all the time.

David Gergen: Trump's foolish war with the press

November 27

David Gergen

In other words, we are witness to a war between Trump and the press, playing out every day in newspapers and television. Each morning brings a new revelation; each evening touches off a shouting match. It is difficult to remember any press secretary since Nixon's Ron Ziegler who has faced so much suspicion from the Fourth Estate.

Yet what is equally surprising is how oblivious this White House is to what has gone wrong and how to fix it. His team is as disdainful of history as it is of time-honored traditions about press-government relations. Either they suffer from massive incompetence or extraordinary arrogance.

History has been quite clear: The presidents who have built the best relationships with the press are those who respect its place in American life, have enjoyed a give and take with reporters and care about the truth. From Democrats like Franklin Roosevelt and Jack Kennedy to Republicans like Teddy Roosevelt and Ronald Reagan, press coverage has been much more favorable because those leaders in the Oval Office were not only good copy but men of character in their public lives.

Mark Bauerlein: Why Trump is still winning

December 5

Mark Bauerlein

This is the real battle going on in D.C. today: not Democrats vs. Republicans but President Donald Trump vs. establishment Republicans. Trump is trampling upon every taboo and sensitivity that liberalism has erected in the last 50 years, and Republican leaders have learned to get by in that uptight habitat. ...

And now, the needle seems to tilt Trump's way.

This correction is not that hard to understand. You see, Trump has an invincible ally at the far end of the ideological spectrum. I don't mean the extreme right, the nationalists, paleoconservatives, and fringe groups that the media relentlessly tie to the President. He has better friends at the other pole, people on the far left who see the world only through the lens of race, gender, sexuality and victimhood.

Arianne Zucker, I have no fear, so 'Access Hollywood' tape will never define me

December 6

Arianne Zucker

Now that the "Access Hollywood" tape is back in the news after reports that Donald Trump questions its authenticity, I am puzzled for this reason: Just from experience, anyone who has ever been on television before, with a microphone pinned to them, should always assume that someone is listening. And when you get caught speaking poorly about someone, at least own up to it.

People ask me whether I need or want an individual apology from either now-President Trump or Billy Bush. Well, apologizing to me would be the appropriate thing to do. Am I losing sleep over it waiting for one? Absolutely not.

I refuse to let a situation such as this one take away my emotional power. You are who you allow yourself to be and I did not and will not let this event or any of its aftermath affect who I am as a woman, mother, daughter, friend and partner to a great man. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Eleanor McManus was a senior producer for CNN's Larry King Live, and is the cofounder of Trident DMG, a crisis management and strategic communications firm. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author.

(CNN) The first 10 years of my professional career were spent at CNN. Beginning as a production assistant, I worked my way up to senior producer for "Larry King Live." I had the most amazing opportunities to work incredible news stories, and even met my husband at CNN. I loved everything about TV news -- the excitement, the ability to be part of breaking a story, the adrenaline, and the camaraderie of the entire news team.

But my career at CNN -- and in journalism, for that matter -- almost didn't happen.

When I was a 21-year-old student, I attended a political event in Boston. Present were several candidates running for president. It was interesting to see political leaders speak in person for the first time, but it wasn't the speeches that intrigued me -- it was the cameras in the back of the room. The media asking questions, trying to break stories, making their news reports -- that was most exciting to me.

So I worked up the courage to go to the back of the room to speak with one of the journalists. That's when I met Mark Halperin, who was at that time working for ABC News. He gave me his card, told me to give him a call and said he would help me understand how to get into the business.

Fast forward several months later to when I graduated and asked for an informational meeting. I reached out to Mr. Halperin and he asked me to come see him. I was thrilled that someone from ABC News was willing to meet with me -- perhaps that was my way in the door. It was my first official meeting; I even had to buy a suit for the occasion.

I don't quite remember what we talked about, but I do remember him asking me to sit down next to him on the couch. I thought it was awkward to sit on the couch when I was perfectly comfortable sitting in the chair across from his desk. But I complied, and I also remember him sitting a little too close to me.

At one point I felt a bit too uncomfortable, and I stood up to thank him for the meeting. That's when he leaned in, tried to kiss me, and attempted to do a bit more. I didn't want to offend the man in charge of political programming at ABC News, and I tried to be courteous and apologetic, and practically ran out of the office. I was upset not by his actions, but the thought that I did something wrong to encourage that behavior. Was my suit too revealing? Did I lead him on? Was this what I had to expect if I went into broadcast news or journalism? If so, I didn't want any part of it.

Luckily, I was resilient back then and I didn't let this situation detour my hopes and dreams. I moved to Washington, DC and studied journalism full-time. When I finally landed a position at CNN on "Larry King Live," I booked celebrities, politicians, and all sorts of newsmakers. One person I vowed never to book on the show was Mark Halperin. If that was my only payback, then so be it.

Over the years I've told this story to several people, and only because it irritated me that someone like him became more and more successful and grew through the ranks, getting away with his behavior for so long. It only came to an end this week when CNN reported the accounts of five women who said Halperin had sexually harassed women while at ABC.

As difficult a decision as it was, I thought it was time to come forward with my personal story because hopefully other women will have the courage to come forward and tell their own stories, no longer remaining silent for fear of retribution.

Looking back, knowing what I know now, I should not have been so courteous and apologetic. I should have told him his actions were wrong and reported him to the ABC News HR department. But, as many have said before me, I was young and naive and didn't want to ruin my career before it even began.

JUST WATCHED Not just Hollywood: Survivors share their stories Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Not just Hollywood: Survivors share their stories 02:01

I'm telling my story publicly now because I hope that when this happens again to another young woman, and it will, she will not be so courteous and apologetic. I'm hoping women today will finally speak out in real-time -- when this behavior happens. Women cannot stay silent for fear it will damage their careers, because that only allows the aggressor to continue his behavior with other women.

I don't think this behavior will ever go away. But I do hope that from now on, women will finally speak out when it happens to them. Maybe it will empower others -- both men and women -- to stand up for themselves, and predators will no longer be able to get away with their abhorrent behavior.

---------

A spokesperson for Halperin declined to comment, but pointed us to Halperin's Wednesday night statement, responding to a CNN article detailing allegations against him by five other women: "During this period, I did pursue relationships with women that I worked with, including some junior to me. I now understand from these accounts that my behavior was inappropriate and caused others pain. For that, I am deeply sorry and I apologize. Under the circumstances, I'm going to take a step back from my day-to-day work while I properly deal with this situation."

On Thursday, HBO, which, like CNN, is owned by Time Warner, issued the following statement: "HBO is no longer proceeding with the project tied to the untitled book co-authored by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the 2016 Presidential election. HBO has no tolerance for sexual harassment within the company or its productions."

A spokesman for MSNBC, where Halperin has worked as a political analyst, said in a statement: "We find the story and the allegations very troubling. Mark Halperin is leaving his role as a contributor until the questions around his past conduct are fully understood." <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Story highlights Nikki Haley: Widespread human rights violations a warning sign that breakdown in security is coming

Syrian war just one example of how such violations can spiral into all-out war, she says

Ambassador Nikki R. Haley is the United States Permanent Representative to the United Nations and a member of President Donald Trump's Cabinet. The views expressed are her own.

(CNN) Imagine you are the parent of a boy -- a teenager. Policemen come to your home in the middle of the night and take your boy away. He is held without explanation for weeks. And when he finally comes home, your boy has all the marks of having been tortured. Bruises from being beaten. Red, open wounds from being burned. Then you look at his hands and the worst is confirmed. Where his fingernails once were, there are only raw, bloody, exposed nerves. Grown men with pliers, he tells you, ripped his fingernails off in prison.

For a group of parents in Syria in 2011, this was not an exercise in imagination but a horrifying reality. Their boys were arrested and tortured for the crime of writing anti-government graffiti on the wall of a school. When the parents marched in protest to demand their children's release, security services opened fire on them. When more people came out to protest the killings, the government fired on them again. Soon, the point of no return was reached.

Nikki Haley

"We were asking in a peaceful way to release the children but their reply was bullets," a relative of one of the boys told a reporter . "Now we can have no compromise with any security branches."

The Syrian war is just one example of how human rights violations can become a vicious cycle of violence and instability that quickly spirals into all-out war. What began as an act of free expression of the kind Americans take for granted has become a conflict responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths and millions of desperate refugees. Nations thousands of miles away have been impacted.

As the U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations, I've looked at how we can do more to respond to human rights violations before they reach the level of conflict. Traditionally, the United Nations Security Council has been considered the place where peace and security are debated, not human rights. But Tuesday, at the insistence of the United States, for the first time the Security Council took up the connection between human rights and conflict. We debated how widespread human rights violations are a warning sign -- a loud, blaring siren -- that a breakdown in peace and security is coming.

Story highlights Douglas Heye: Wednesday's attack on Republicans at a baseball field reminds us that hateful rhetoric accumulates and causes things to escalate

Whomever the targets, it was perhaps inescapable that something tragic was coming in an environment like this, Heye writes

Douglas Heye is a CNN political commentator and former deputy chief of staff to then-House Majority Leader Eric Cantor. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.

(CNN) Shortly after Wednesday morning's attack on Republican members of Congress practicing for the annual Congressional Baseball Game, Congressman Rodney Davis, still in his baseball clothes, spoke to CNN's Brianna Keilar.

In addition to describing the events he witnessed, he spoke from the heart.

"This hatefulness that we see in this country today over policy differences has got to stop ... Republicans and Democrats need to use this day today to stand together and say 'stop.' Let's work together. Let's get things done," he said. "We can have our differences, but let's not let it lead to such hate."

Douglas Heye

We should all heed Congressman Davis' call, including our President. Since his announcement to run for office, Donald Trump has consistently yelled fire in a crowded political theater by castigating various segments of our population and encouraging his supporters to " knock the crap " out of protesters. And on and on.

Many Donald Trump supporters have followed his lead, escalating the rhetoric against political opponents and the media. A reporter was choke-slammed in Montana. And before Trump, too many Republicans engaged in awful and, let's face it, racist attacks on President Obama. Perhaps even worse, too many Republicans watched this happen and remained silent.

Story highlights The US has long respected and promoted science, Nye writes

Nye: Science is being undermined by ideological forces motivated to maintain the status quo

Bill Nye, known as Bill Nye the Science Guy, is an American science educator, television presenter, and mechanical engineer. He is the CEO of The Planetary Society, the world's largest non-profit space interest group. The opinions expressed are his own.

(CNN) I was proud to join thousands of concerned citizens, scientists and engineers in Saturday's March for Science. With more than 600 marches taking place around the world, we conveyed that science is political, not partisan, and science should shape our policies.

Although it is the means by which humankind discovers objective truths in nature, science is and has always been political. Article I, Section 8 of the US Constitution refers to promoting "the progress of science and useful arts" to motivate innovators, stimulate the economy and establish just laws.

The US has become the most powerful nation on Earth and among the greatest in history, because it has long respected and promoted science. Countless policies, from military deployments to regulations that control the formula of a shampoo, are based on science.

Scientific research depends on government investment (approximately $65 billion in the US last year), which itself relies on a social compact: that basic research across all fields is beneficial to a nation.

Currently, science is being actively undermined by ideological forces motivated to maintain the status quo rather than advance the nation's long-term interest. This is especially true of the extractive fossil fuel industries. When facing tides of deliberate misinformation, scientists, engineers and researchers have taken it upon themselves to organize and raise awareness about their professions and the vital importance of the scientific enterprise.

George Takei is an actor and activist. His Broadway show "Allegiance" screens across cinemas in the United States on the Day of Remembrance, February 19. Follow him on Twitter @GeorgeTakei. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

(CNN) I was just a child of 5 when soldiers marched up our driveway in a Los Angeles residential neighborhood, bayonets in hand, and pounded on our front door, ordering us out. We were permitted only what we could carry, no bedding, no pets.

I remember my mother's tears as she and our father gathered us up, with our precious few belongings in hand. She was determined to bring a sewing machine, fearful that we would need to make or mend clothes where we were headed. She wasn't sure the authorities would allow her to take that Singer machine, so she kept it a secret, even from us. She managed, however, to pack a few treats for us children for the long journey ahead.

That was in 1942. Earlier that year, on February 19, 75 years ago yesterday, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order, No. 9066, which set the internment into motion. On its face, the order was "neutral," authorizing the military to designate whole swaths of land as military zones, and evacuate any persons from it as they saw fit.

But behind that facade lay a much darker purpose: to tear 120,000 innocent Japanese-Americans from their homes along the West Coast and relocate them to 10 prison camps scattered throughout the United States.

It didn't matter, back then , that most of us were US citizens and had never even been to Japan. We were presumed guilty, and held without charge for four years, simply because we happened to look like the people who had bombed Pearl Harbor. For that crime, we lost our homes, our livelihoods and our freedoms.

Every year, on February 19, we Japanese-Americans honor this day as Remembrance Day, and we renew our pledge to make sure what happened to us never happens again in America. I am always amazed, and saddened, that despite our decadeslong efforts, so many young people today are not even aware that such a tragedy and miscarriage of justice took place here.

Photos: Portraits from 'a great injustice' In 1943, legendary photographer Ansel Adams took portraits of Japanese-Americans interned at Manzanar Relocation Camp in California. "The purpose of my work was to show how these people, suffering under a great injustice, and loss of property, businesses and professions, had overcome the sense of defeat and despair by building for themselves a vital community in an arid (but magnificent) environment," Adams stated in a letter written when he offered the collection of images to the Library of Congress.

And I grow increasingly concerned that we are careening toward a future where such a thing would again be possible.

A few months into his campaign, Donald Trump refused to outright reject the policies and fears that underlay the internment. Instead, he suggested that it was a tough call, and that he "would have had to be there" in order to know whether it was the wrong one.

I cannot help but hear in these words terrible echoes from the past. The internment happened because of three things: fear, prejudice and a failure of political leadership. When the administration targets groups today, whether for exclusion from travel here on the basis of religion and national origin, or for deportation based on their undocumented status, I know from personal experience that these are not done, as they claim, truly in the name of national security.

No, instead they are intended to strike fear into communities, to show the muscle and "toughness" of a new president, and to divide the citizenry against itself. These are the acts of a despot, not an elected leader.

I have dedicated my life to standing against our nation's impulse toward demagoguery and tyranny by the whipped-up masses. The answer lies not just in education, but in empathy. The false narrative -- that there are those who belong here and those who do not -- is designed precisely to divorce us from the truth that we are all here and in this together.

We are an interdependent people, sharing a common bond of humanity. The most pernicious aspect of Trump's policies is thus the denial of those basic bonds and that humanity. I will not stand for it, and no people of good conscience should.

The question before us, then, on Remembrance Day is a simple one: Will America remember? The internment is not a "precedent," it is a stark and painful lesson. We will only learn from the past if we know, understand and remember it. For if we fail, we most assuredly are doomed to repeat it. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Story highlights Contrary to what Sean Spicer said, Axelrod says he and Robert Gibbs did not regularly attend the most sensitive National Security Council meetings

Axelrod: Former Breitbart chief Steve Bannon will exercise authority no political adviser has had before

David Axelrod is CNN's senior political commentator and host of the podcast "The Axe Files." He was senior adviser to President Barack Obama and chief strategist for the 2008 and 2012 Obama campaigns. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.

(CNN) I woke up this morning as an Alternative Fact.

In justifying the appointment of Steve Bannon, the president's chief strategist, to the National Security Council, Trump spokesman Sean Spicer cited my role in the Obama White House as a precedent. Spicer said press secretary Robert Gibbs and I attended classified National Security Council meetings "all the time."

That is simply not true.

As a senior adviser to President Obama in 2009, I had the opportunity to witness the fateful deliberations of his National Security Council Principals committee over the strategy the U.S would pursue in the war with Al Qaeda in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

I was not a member of the committee. I did not speak or participate. I sat on the sidelines as a silent observer with Gibbs because we would be called upon to publicly discuss the president's decision on that critical matter and the process by which he arrived at it.

(CNN) This time last year, CNN Opinion asked a group of commentators from around the world for their take on the US presidential election. One year later, Donald Trump is preparing to be sworn in as President of the United States. So, what is the world expecting -- and hoping for -- from a Trump presidency? Guest commentators from around the world weigh in. The views expressed are their own.

Russia: A domestic win for Putin

When Donald Trump was declared the winner of the 2016 presidential election, he received a round of applause in the Russian parliament. It was a pure, almost childish expression of joy.

Since then, the "Russian factor" has loomed ominously over Trump's impending presidency. The Russian term " kompromat " -- compromising material -- is entering the English language, much like "sputnik" did more than 50 years ago. The American press debates -- in total seriousness -- whether the Kremlin is literally keeping the President of the most powerful country on Earth on its leash and shaping his policies. More importantly, the notorious hacking story is far from over. For many in Washington, Vladimir Putin has become the main trickster of the election.

However, Russian officialdom was hardly expecting a Trump victory. Viewing the American election as a zero-sum game with the West, Putin planned for a likely defeat. Before Election Day, Russia's propaganda machine was warming up to announce that a flawed American political system would never let the anti-establishment candidate win. That was supposed to be Russia's consolation prize.

Then, defeat suddenly turned into victory. Russia is beyond satisfied with this serendipitous turn of events. A happy and astounded Kremlin will now try to get the most from Trump -- from easing sanctions to making a deal on Syria and settling the Ukraine issue.

It is difficult, of course, to predict how Trump's administration will address these issues and what the result will be. But this uncertainty hardly undermines the feeling that Russian officialdom has been experiencing: a sense they have achieved a moral victory over the West and its values.

Since the annexation of Crimea, the West has labeled Putin a pariah and a global threat. Yet now, Trump's win has made something clear: It is not Putin who is a weak outlier before the world's liberal order. Rather, it is the West that is divided and full of resentment. An outcast yesterday, Putin may now see himself as a major power broker in the emerging global Trumpworld.

The least that the Kremlin will now expect from the White House is a display of respect and equality. After what has been presented by Russian propaganda as years of unprecedented humiliation and offense from the West, Putin will easily sell his country's newfound parity with the United States to the Russian public for his own personal gain.

Transforming Putin's moral triumph into a dramatic expansion of Russian influence on the global stage will be trickier. But from the Kremlin's point of view, it is probably doable.

Mexico: Will Trump really pursue his 'Mexican agenda'?

Ana Maria Salazar

Throughout his campaign, we all hoped he would tone down such rhetoric so as not to alienate the Hispanic vote (too much, at least). However, his rhetoric simply became more vitriolic -- and more threatening.

So President Enrique Peña Nieto invited him to Mexico , perhaps in hopes that the hospitality and reality of bilateral relations would change Donald Trump´s opinion about the southern border (and awkward facts such as there being potentially millions of jobs at stake -- on both sides of the border -- if he decided to scrap NAFTA).

But mere hours after returning from Mexico, not only did Trump NOT change his mind, but he engaged ( in Arizona of all places ) in some of his most anti-immigration rhetoric yet. Meanwhile, in Mexico there was a backlash against Peña Nieto's decision to invite Trump, forcing Finance Minister Luis Videgaray -- seen as instrumental in arranging the visit -- out of the Cabinet.

As the votes were tallied on election night, there was hope that Trump's rhetoric was campaign garbage and not genuine policy. But in the two months since the election, Trump has reiterated his calls for a wall, insisted that Mexico will reimburse the US for the cost and called for the renegotiation of NAFTA and a border tax for companies that invest in Mexico and wish to send their products to the United States.

On the back of all this, the Mexican peso has plunged, and there is concern that on January 20, the least popular person in decades to be sworn in as US President will deliver a speech that could be catastrophic for the Mexican economy.

Since losing his role at the finance ministry, Luis Videgaray has been appointed foreign minister, and will head negotiations with the United States. Perhaps the President is hoping that Trump will now play and negotiate in an appropriate way. He likely is wrong.

Through his threats, tweets, and speeches, Trump may have left the President and his negotiators with no political wiggle room to sign any kind of agreement that requires ratification by the Mexican Senate. And the chances for a candidate from Peña Nieto's party will likely be scuppered in the 2018 presidential elections unless the President can convince Trump not to initiate massive deportations and to stop insisting on building the wall.

But if Trump believes his "Mexican agenda" helped get him elected, it is hard to imagine he will do anything but continue to insist on his beautiful wall, deportations and a new and "improved" NAFTA agreement.

Israel: Netanyahu breathes a sigh of relief

Yaakov Katz

After eight years of hostility and tension with President Barack Obama, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will let out a huge sigh of relief Friday when Donald Trump is sworn in as the 45th president of the United States.

For Netanyahu and his right-wing coalition government, Trump's presidency is viewed as a new beginning when it comes to Israeli-US relations. One government minister went so far as to say that Trump's victory in November signals that "the days of the Messiah" have come.

That might be a stretch, but for Israel, Trump seems like the antithesis of the outgoing president.

While Obama regularly pressured Israel to stop construction in Jewish settlements in the West Bank, Trump's advisers have said they will not. While Obama refused to move the US Embassy to Jerusalem, Trump has said that he will . And while Obama championed the Iran deal that Israel aggressively tried to prevent, Trump has raised the possibility that he will scrap it.

While this all bodes well for the current government in Jerusalem, it remains to be seen what Trump will do when it comes to Israel's ongoing conflict with the Palestinians. Will he follow the longstanding US policy of pushing for a two-state solution or will he offer new options for a resolution?

Will he stand strong against settlement expansion or will he allow Israeli annexation of settlements as some government ministers are advocating?

So far, Trump hasn't said much, although the announcement that his son-in-law Jared Kushner will serve as the president's Middle East envoy seems to indicate that he plans to take on the thorny issue.

Like other countries in the Middle East, Israel is hoping to see a more engaged America playing an active role in the region. The presence of Russian military forces in Syria, for example, is believed to be directly linked to Obama's decision not to enforce his "red line" on the use of chemical weapons in that ongoing civil war and humanitarian disaster. Leaving a vacuum allowed Russia to enter the country.

Will Trump re-engage the Middle East or will he prefer to remain on the sidelines and stay away from a region that has for decades frustrated consecutive American presidents?

Starting on January 20, the world will begin to get some answers.

India: Did America get its Modi?

Sanjay Kumar

On the eve of the inauguration of Donald Trump, India is experiencing some of the same kind of anxiety it felt when Narendra Modi was about to become the country's prime minister, back in May 2014

A right-wing Hindu leader with a controversial political past who cultivated an image as an outsider, Modi's rise to power disturbed the existing political equilibrium in the country, and his election brought with it a heightened sense of unpredictability and uncertainty among not just Indians, but overseas as well. Indeed, for many -- particularly the country's liberals -- it took quite some time for the reality of a Modi premiership to sink in.

A sense of disbelief and uncertainty has gripped many people here again.

Will the improvement in India-US relations continue with a Trump administration? How will Indians settled and working in the United States be treated? Will the protectionist measures that Trump is talking about impact Indians living abroad? Will such policies affect the outsourcing that keeps so many Indians in India working?

These are just some of the questions Indians have. But the questions also extend to international affairs -- how is India going to adjust if Washington decides to revise Obama's policy towards the Middle East and western Asia? Policymakers in New Delhi are already worried, for example, that reimposing sanctions on Iran would impact India's crude oil supply and delay the completion of Chabahar port that will create a new trade route for Afghanistan and drastically alter the trade dynamics in South Asia.

In addition, New Delhi is also keenly waiting to see how Trump goes about dealing with Pakistan. Will he continue the old policy of transactional engagement with the Muslim state or take a firm line over its support for terror groups?

But there is a more philosophical concern among liberals in India: The potential impact of a close political entente between Modi and Trump. The fear is that the political proximity between the two leaders, who have strong anti-Muslim, anti-minority images, will unleash and strengthen forces inimical to liberal and secular values. Such sentiment is already simmering in India since Modi assumed office in 2014 -- and his presence has contributed to keeping the Indo-Pakistan relationship on tenterhooks.

Many on the Indian subcontinent see Trump as Modi's alter ego. Closer ties between them might prove to be a double-edged sword for our country.

Britain: Trump creates a stir

On Monday, the British people learned that Donald Trump's late mother was an admirer of the British monarchy. "She loved the ceremonial and the beauty, 'cause nobody does that like the English," he told an interviewer

A family weakness for the British nostalgia industry is unlikely to have much impact on his approval rating among a population deeply concerned about the President-elect's ethics, prejudices and mental stability.

What did get the UK talking was the identity of the interviewer. Michael Gove, who recently left the British Cabinet after losing a leadership election, has returned to his role as a columnist for The Times of London. He remains a prominent figure in Westminster politics and has retained his seat in the House of Commons.

Meeting with Trump in his capacity as a journalist, Gove is only the latest right-wing figure to irk the British government by flaunting a relationship with the President-elect outside official channels. Prime Minister Theresa May, who clashed frequently with Gove when they were Cabinet colleagues under David Cameron, has made clear that such freelance diplomacy will not hasten his political rehabilitation.

Even Gove, however, failed to match the stir created when the President-elect was pictured with Nigel Farage, the former leader of the UK Independence Party, before he had met representatives of the governing Conservative Party.

When Trump then suggested on Twitter that Farage should be appointed ambassador to Washington, May was furious. In Britain, where ambassadorships are traditionally held by long-serving career diplomats, this was seen as unprecedented interference in the affairs of Her Majesty's Government. The Queen nominally appoints each ambassador and takes a close interest due to her contacts with other heads of state. If Trump shares his mother's fondness for the Queen's ceremonial role in British life, he would be well advised to respect her protocol.

As well as securing a scoop for The Times, Gove's main aim in meeting the President-elect will likely have been to impress on him the existence of prominent Brexiteers other than Nigel Farage. Farage has enjoyed high visibility on British TV, his divisive rhetoric delivering strong ratings. Unlike Trump, he has not succeeded in translating that into electoral success, having failed at seven attempts to win a seat in Parliament . He was excluded by the official "Vote Leave" campaign in the UK referendum, run by more mainstream members of the Conservative Party, and campaigned instead with a smaller, unregistered "Leave EU" team dominated by UKIP. The anti-European movement in Britain is riddled with personal divisions; Gove, who played a major role in "Vote Leave", will have bridled at Farage taking credit for the referendum.

None of these subtleties are likely to deter the British government from maintaining a formal alliance with the United States as long as it remains a world power. But the President-elect would be wise to avoid playing favorites with squabbling British politicians. Serious concerns remain about the future of the relationship with Britain; elements in the security services are concerned about the legal implications for the " Five-Eyes " intelligence sharing system should Trump authorize the use of torture by their American partners. In Scotland, he has long been an unpopular landlord, indulging in an ongoing feud with the ruling Scottish National Party over environmental and planning issues.

Diplomacy by Twitter is not the British way. The Queen would not approve.

Germany: Will Merkel confront Trump?

Almut Möller

From a Berlin perspective, there is a particular irony in the inauguration of Donald Trump as the next US president. Today's Germany in many ways is a product of the post-World War II era in Europe on which the United States has spent so much time and resources over the past decades.

Locking Germany into a collective European order has been key to pacifying the European continent, and has served Germany particularly well. Indeed, the principles that are so strongly rooted in this country are largely tied to the pacifist attitudes of the German public and a preference for an economic rather than a security role in foreign affairs. There is also a strong reflexive support among Germans for multilateral approaches aimed at building global institutions and international law, as well as for the need for Germany to have a predictable foreign policy.

But what Berlin has understood from the President-elect so far is that Donald Trump is not really very interested in any of these principles. Instead, his rhetoric runs counter to some of the most formative instincts of the political elite in Germany -- and of the public at large. The question Germans have now is how Berlin will react once President Trump actually starts to shape politics rather than talking about it?

And there has been plenty in the talk so far to cause concern. For example, just last weekend, Trump gave a major interview with widely read German newspaper BILD Zeitung in which he called into question the role of NATO and the future cohesion of the European Union. Both institutions are fundamental pillars of German foreign policy.

Angela Merkel gave a first glimpse of her mindset in a news conference with the prime minister of New Zealand in Berlin that same day. "I think we Europeans have our fate in our own hands," she said when asked about Trump's comments. By her usually cautious standards this was another remarkable statement following her initial reaction to Trump's election back in November.

When President Barack Obama gave a speech at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin in the summer of 2013 , he called for an end to German complacency in international affairs. Developments in and around Europe over recent years have already seen a much more active Germany on the European and international stage. Berlin has understood that some of its vital interests -- both in economic and security terms -- have come to be challenged.

Trump is going to ensure Germany accelerates along this path, a reality that will have major implications for Germany and Europe. Berlin has a realistic understanding of its power, and where the German government has the resources to punch its weight it will attempt to do so.

But how willing will Germany be to confront President Trump on fundamental questions over the future of the European and global order? Germany currently holds the G20 presidency. That might give us a sign about how much Merkel is willing to say.

China: Trump should avoid the Taiwan card

Shen Dingli

While the uncertainty surrounding Donald Trump's incoming administration doesn't bode well for anyone, the instability ahead could begin to recede if the new executive branch is willing to learn and acts sensibly.

For instance, Trump has repeatedly demanded "fair trade". No one rejects the idea of fair trade, but if the focus is on "fair" rather than "unfair" trade, then the key issue is who decides what type of trade is fair or otherwise.

As long as the United States does not exit the World Trade Organization, America, like any other member of the WTO, is subject to the body's arbitration mechanism to settle trade disputes.

The Trump administration may renegotiate the North America Free Trade Agreement or quit the Trans Pacific Partnership, but if it does, it will still be opting for negotiation and bilateral trade agreements with Asia-Pacific nations and other trade partners. In other words, Trump may not be a fan of globalism, but he still subscribes to bilateralism and even internationalism.

China, for its part, could well live with a China-US bilateral trade and investment framework, along with a WTO cap. The ongoing negotiation of the Bilateral Investment Treaty is an example. Trump wants "smart" negotiation, to which China has no objection. But if Trump refuses to settle disputes through negotiation, then China won't be happy.

Still, China is wary of the possibility that the Trump team might try to play the Taiwan card as part of any bargaining. This would be unacceptable -- China may be willing to negotiate or renegotiate over trade, investment and currency levels, but it will in no way be willing to renegotiate the "One China" principle . This is one thing that China will never put up for sale.

If the Trump administration can understand this key point quickly, and if it acts in a diplomatic way, then Trump does indeed have a chance to make America truly great again.

South Africa: Trump brings a new style

Tinashe Chuchu

South Africans in general were more inclined to support Hillary Clinton for president, but that did not happen. Why the support for Clinton? Because South Africans valued the longstanding relationship that their nation had developed with the Clintons, especially during the Mandela years.

Now that the election is over and Donald Trump has won, South Africa -- like many other nations -- hopes that it will be able to secure favorable trade relations with the Trump administration. Of course, the signs from the Trump camp suggest that the incoming administration will take a tough stance on trade. And though Trump did not single out South Africa specifically for criticism, he did warn more broadly that deals would need to be rethought because the United States is always losing out on trade agreements.

Another issue that might be of interest to South Africans is US immigration policy toward South Africa. Again, Trump warned over the threat posed by certain kinds of immigration, which became a feature of his campaign. If he cracks down it could make it tougher for South Africans wishing to secure a US visa.

But it's not all trepidation. Some South Africans admire Trump's apparent success with his own businesses. They hope that he will enjoy similar success running the United States. Indeed, if Trump is successful and the US economy performs well under his presidency, countries like South Africa will likely benefit, too.

As John Stremlau, former vice president of the Carter Center, told Africa's News24 , it is still unclear what shape the Trump administration's foreign policy will take. However, as a businessman, it seems that Trump is determined to try his hand at making deals. It will be interesting to see what this new style means for business with Africa.

Egypt: A lesson for Americans

Adel Abdel Ghafar

The election of Donald Trump was welcome news in Cairo. The US President-elect and Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi met each other on the sidelines of the U.N. General Assembly meeting last September. After that meeting, both expressed a mutual admiration for one another. Sisi remarked that Trump would make a strong leader, which Trump reciprocated by praising Sisi as a "fantastic guy." Sisi was reportedly the first Arab leader to congratulate Trump, and recently reportedly stated to the Egyptian press that he knew Trump would win as "his honesty touched the hearts of the American people."

It's not hard to imagine why these two men would get along. Both are not particularly fond of protecting human rights, and have demonstrated a deep disdain for the press. They abhor Islamists of all shapes and forms. Neither man handles criticism well, as demonstrated by their emotional outbursts. Both admire Vladimir Putin, who has spent time cultivating them both.

Overall, they share an identical black and white world view, reminiscent of George W. Bush's "you are either with us or against us." There is no middle way in Trump and Sisi's world; only enemies to be annihilated or friends based on mutual interests.

With regards to Egypt and the Middle East, discourse on human rights and democratization will become background noise, as the Trump administration's foreign policy will likely focus on advancing US economic and security interests. Trump and Sisi began collaborating even before the President-elect assumed office: Trump reportedly called on Sisi to withdraw the U.N. resolution against Israeli settlements , which ultimately passed.

Conveniently, the Egyptian media has dropped the commentary from Trump about Muslim bans and registries from its coverage, while equating the President-elect with Sisi; a strongman who will bring stability in an age of turbulence. However, almost three years since Sisi's election, many segments of the Egyptian population feel disappointed in his leadership, as he has failed to bring stability or usher in the era of economic prosperity that he promised.

Given time, the American people, like their Egyptian counterparts, are also likely to find themselves profoundly unhappy with their new president.

Philippines: Will Trump challenge Duterte?

Mong Palatino

Considering that there are, by some estimates , around 300,000 Filipinos living as undocumented migrants in the United States, the question for many here is whether President Donald Trump will be true to his campaign promise of being tough on illegal immigration.

As for the about 3.5 million Filipinos living in the United States , they join other Americans in hoping that the Trump presidency will deliver stable jobs, better health care, and safer communities.

Like other Southeast Asian countries, the Philippines wants to know whether Trump will continue to endorse the rebalancing of American forces toward the Asia-Pacific region. More specifically, Filipinos have two other questions on defense: What will Trump's policy be regarding the maritime dispute in the South China Sea involving China and its smaller neighbors? Will he uphold the mutual defense pact between the Philippines and the United States?

It is not only on defense that a Trump presidency raises questions for Filipinos. In terms of his economic program, for example, many wonder whether his vow to protect American businesses will mean less investment in the Philippines and the rest of Asia? They also wonder whether his call for the return of manufacturing and outsourced jobs to the United States will disrupt Asian economies.

Interestingly, Trump is often compared to Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte. Both are non-traditional politicians who achieved surprising electoral victories despite their controversial, divisive -- sometimes politically incorrect -- views.

Duterte has frequently criticized the United States for its colonial crimes and political meddling, even making an unprecedented declaration of a "separation" of the Philippines and the United States. President Obama chose to ignore Duterte's rants. Will Trump do the same thing? Will he comment on the alleged American plot to destabilize Duterte's government

Both are interesting questions. But perhaps the biggest question mark is over whether Donald Trump will raise the issue of human rights with Duterte, whose war on drugs has, by many accounts, left thousands of civilians dead.

Filipinos are extremely curious to find out what happens next.

David Axelrod is CNN's senior political commentator and host of the podcast " The Axe Files. " He was senior adviser to President Barack Obama and chief strategist for the 2008 and 2012 Obama campaigns. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.

(CNN) The walls, just days earlier bedecked with portraits of President Obama at work, were covered with empty frames, awaiting a new leading man.

The hallways that had been buzzing with energy were strangely still, as all but the most senior staff had already turned in their badges and moved on. In the mostly emptied West Wing, those who remained packed up a few last items between hugs, handshakes, laughs and memories.

The White House on Thursday was winding down, the day before the wheel of democracy turns out one cast and ushers in another.

As the hours ticked down on the Obama era, I returned to see old colleagues and friends, some of whom had walked into that citadel of American government with me eight years ago.

On that day, the vibe was entirely different. The place filled with the frenetic energy of something new and momentous.

Even as we located our offices and familiarized ourselves with our rarified surroundings, we plunged into the work of saving the country from an epic economic crisis -- the worst since the Great Depression. There were two wars raging and 180,000 troops in harm's way and Osama bin Laden was alive and still plotting against America.

What we would quickly learn is that as we labored through these challenges, others would arrive unexpectedly. Pirates, pandemics and massive oil leaks on the sea floor do not fit neatly into your planning calendar. That's the nature of the presidency. Events have a way of hijacking your days and the story.

I smiled the other day when the president, at his final news conference, shared the advice he had given his children in times of stress. "The only thing that's the end of the world...is the end of the world," he said.

His wisdom and equanimity had helped the country and buoyed his staff through times that felt as if they could be the end of the world. And those qualities were on display again these past two months when a stunning election result left so many unsettled.

Those who lingered at the White House on Thursday wondered which pieces of Obama's legacy would survive the stark change of leadership that Friday will bring. But there are so many things that simply cannot be erased.

History will record that at a time of maximum crisis, this president made a series of courageous and difficult decisions to save our economy and the American auto industry. I was there. I saw it. He never flinched.

He had the foresight, through the Recovery Act, to plant the seeds of a renewable energy industry that has blossomed and is the future. It will not be turned back.

He fought for equal rights for all Americans and helped lead to a sea change in how gay Americans are treated. On this issue, our country is not going back.

And while the incoming administration and Congress have made the repeal of Obamacare their rallying cry, no longer is it considered acceptable for people with pre-existing conditions to be refused insurance, or women to be charged exponentially more than men.

Americans now expect to be able to cover their adult children up to the age of 26, and they won't accept any plan that dumps 20 million Americans from the insurance rolls.

The reforms that have cut costs and improved care and helped curb runaway inflation in health care spending have changed the industry in lasting ways.

Perhaps spurred by fears of repeal without an adequate replacement, the health care law derisively named for the president by its opponents has never polled as well or been as popular as it is today.

Obama has shifted the starting point for the debate on health care. Wherever it lands, we are never going back to where we were eight years ago.

Beyond his many durable achievements, nothing will erase the memory of a president who brought dignity, honor and integrity to the Oval Office. He set high standards of conduct for those around him. He and his family were wonderful role models, so welcome in these times of coarsening culture.

We'll remember those moments of amazing grace, when he lifted our spirits, and the evenness with which he faced an implacable and sometimes bitter opposition.

Through eight challenging years, he never succumbed to cynicism. He came as a believer in the fundamental ideals of our democracy, he pushed for them and he leaves as their champion.

I stopped in to see my old friend on his final day in the Oval Office. I told him how proud I was of him and grateful to have been along for some of this amazing journey.

"We did some good work here," he said.

As administrations change, it might feel like the end of the world to those who worked for this president and to some of the many Americans who, by the latest counts, like and support him. It is not.

Whatever happens next, he has done some good work that cannot be erased and will not be forgotten. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) Amid the twists and turns of a tumultuous year, readers came to CNN Opinion for context, insight and fresh perspectives on politics and social issues worldwide. The presidential election was clearly a dominant topic of interest, but stories on culture, climate change, and how to be a family in a divisive and sometimes dangerous time in the world also drew avid readership.

Here's a selection of some of the most popular opinion pieces of 2016. The opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely those of the authors.

Roxanne Jones: Beyonce gets Super Bowl show right

February 9

"There were nods to Michael Jackson, to Black Greek step shows, to Malcolm X and a salute to the 50th anniversary of the founding of the Black Panthers. For a minute, watching Beyonce and those strong black women sporting black berets and big afros march out onto the field, I forgot I was watching a Super Bowl performance. For the first time I felt like I wasn't just a spectator of the game but that the game had become a part of my black experience in America. With just a few lyrics, Beyonce connected with black women everywhere. Her performance became personal."

David Axelrod: A surprising request from Justice Scalia

February 14

"Justice David Souter, Scalia's longtime colleague on the court, had just announced his retirement, creating a vacancy for President Obama to fill. Scalia figured that as senior adviser to the new president, I might have some influence on the decision -- or at least enough to pass along a message.

'I have no illusions that your man will nominate someone who shares my orientation,' said Scalia, then in his 23rd year as the court's leading and most provocative conservative voice. 'But I hope he sends us someone smart.'

A little taken aback that he was engaging me on the subject, I searched for the right answer, and lamely offered one that signaled my slight discomfort with the topic. 'I'm sure he will, Justice Scalia.'

He wasn't done. Leaning forward, as if to share a confidential thought, he tried again.

'Let me put a finer point on it,' the justice said, in a lower, purposeful tone of voice, his eyes fixed on mine. 'I hope he sends us Elena Kagan.'"

Jay Parini: Why the hate for Hillary Clinton?

Jay Parini

March 20

"Her achievements in Congress and at the State Department can't be denied, though many will try. Don't forget her courageous China speech on the rights of women, her aggressive work on climate change and her skill as a senator in guiding the Children's Health Insurance Program through Congress. She helped to negotiate a ceasefire with Hamas during a tense moment in Israel. I think of her successes in forging alliances in South America, Africa and Asia, and her part in establishing tough sanctions against Iran. That's only the beginning.

And yet people hate her. Her negative ratings, in fact, have been shockingly high for someone this close to the nomination of her party. Indeed, one of the most frequently posed questions to the candidate herself is some version of 'Why don't they like you?'

Of course, Republicans have known for a long time that Hillary Clinton is an unusually strong candidate, and this terrifies them. So they have seized on talking points like Benghazi (for which she bears little or no responsibility) and her email scandal. On the latter, even columnist Ruth Marcus -- certainly no fan of Clinton's -- recently wrote in The Washington Post that 'there is no clear evidence that Clinton knew (or even should have known) that the material in her emails was classified.' As we've seen, neither Benghazi nor the email trouble are likely to put off Democratic voters, who regard them as Republican talking points."

Danny Cevallos: Abby Wambach's arrest for a crime that makes no sense

Danny Cevallos

April 4

"Why? Why do people who otherwise would never commit a crime somehow get arrested for drunken driving? Sure, it's a question of personal responsibility, but why is it so much easier for upstanding citizens to refrain from all other crimes, except DUI?

It's the mixed signals. Most other criminal activity unambiguously violates our social norms. There's no 'gray area' when it comes to smoking meth at a cocktail party, for example. Most crimes are also social faux pas, such that you would neither engage in, nor tolerate the behavior from a peer.

With DUIs, however, there are mixed messages. Most people are surprised to learn that it's not actually illegal to drink and drive. Technically, it's only illegal to drive while 'impaired' by alcohol. What does 'impaired' mean?"

But why do we care what anyone weighs? Well, the stakes are high when being thin or fat determines whether you'll be loved, respected, hired, promoted, dated, married, able to travel, buy clothes, see people who look like you in mainstream media, get unbiased medical care, and count as a person -- or not. (And these are just a few examples.)"

John D. Sutter: 'There's no more land'

John D. Sutter

April 8

"Shortsighted government officials have strangled the Mississippi River with so many dams and levees that it doesn't deliver the soil that's needed to rebuild the marshes. Instead, all of that useful dirt, which normally would be deposited slowly as the river wiggles across a wide and free delta, is rushed out to the bottom of the sea. Oil and gas canals and pipelines, meanwhile, have carved up what's left of the marsh, making it more vulnerable to collapse."

Stephanie Coontz: The awkward truth of 'make America great again'

Stephanie Coontz

April 29

"Idealizing the era when America was the economic powerhouse of the world, bipartisanship reigned and male breadwinner families were the norm requires overlooking much else. Nostalgia is never random. We cherry-pick the past, highlighting what we like and leaving out the things we don't, even if they were closely intertwined.

So when Trump says let's "make America great again" and Clinton says let's make it 'whole again,' they neglect to mention how much the prosperity of the postwar era depended on a system of regulation and taxation that neither of them shows any inclination to reinstate."

Michael D'Antonio: Donald Trump isn't crazy

Michael D'Antonio

August 2

"As 16 Republican primary opponents failed to stop Trump's momentum, the idea that he is crazy seemed to miss the mark. The word "crazy" conjures up a person who is so plagued by delusions, or perhaps hallucinations, that he makes no sense at all.

Consider his success, both before and during his pursuit of the presidency, and it's hard to argue that Trump suffers from such a profoundly distorted view of reality.

In fact he has long demonstrated a keen awareness of how our society worships celebrity and rewards those who can attract the limelight and hold its focus."

Peter Bergen: Bin Laden's spectacular miscalculation

Peter Bergen

September 8

"For so long the two great oceans of the Atlantic and the Pacific had protected America from its enemies, but no more.

Yet, for all their tactical success the 9/11 attacks failed strategically and, in the end, achieved precisely the opposite of what Osama bin Laden had intended.

There are, of course, differences between the post-World War II era and the post 9/11 era. The long-term aftermath of Pearl Harbor was not only a decisive Allied victory in the war but also decades of American leadership and dominance.

After its initial success in Afghanistan following 9/11, victory was not decisive for the United States. Instead, American forces continued to be at war with a number of shadowy jihadist groups, most recently ISIS, and this now seems like a quasi-permanent state of affairs that could persist well beyond the next presidency."

CNN Commentators: Who won the first presidential debate?

Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton shake hands at the first presidential debate on September 26, 2016, in Hempstead, New York.

September 27

David Gergen: "By all traditional standards of debate, Mrs. Clinton crushed. She carefully marshaled her arguments and facts and then sent them into battle with a smile. She rolled out a long list of indictments against Donald Trump, often damaging. By contrast, he came in unprepared, had nothing fresh to say, and increasingly gave way to rants. As the evening ended, the media buried him in criticisms.

Even so, I doubt she has put him away."

S.E. Cupp: "In contrast, Trump mostly did the job he had to do. To move undecideds, he had to hammer one point home: Clinton is a politician who doesn't get it. Over and over again, he attacked her as more of the same, out of touch, and a politician who hasn't gotten it right. He didn't go after her character or personal issues, for the most part -- which voters know well. She outmanned him on specifics and details. But his attacks were far more effective than hers."

Dean Obeidallah: Trump's beef with SNL is no laughing matter

Dean Obeidallah

October 16

"[Trump's] message was clear: Mock me, and I might sue you.

Couple all this with Trump's calls during this campaign to change the libel laws to make it easier for him to sue media outlets who unfairly criticize him, and this is no laughing matter.

Would a President Trump use the apparatus of the federal government -- such as the Federal Communications Commission -- to intimidate comedians and dissuade them from mocking him? Yes, I know we have a First Amendment, but alarmingly I bet there are Trump supporters who would go along with anything Trump asks for, even if it was flat out unconstitutional. (Trump has bragged as much, claiming he could shoot someone on Fifth Avenue and his supporters would stand with him.)"

The first lady has access to secrets at the discretion of POTUS, the president of the United States. And the president has enormous authority over the use and distribution of the nation's secrets."

Florida could be the decisive state (again) as to who ultimately becomes the next president of the United States. I thought back to the 2000 election, which was decided by 537 votes in Florida. I thought about how I would feel if the same thing happened in 2016. I thought and I thought and I thought....

Then I cast my vote for Hillary Clinton. Let me rephrase that. I cast my vote against Donald Trump. I did it without joy or enthusiasm. I did it out of civic duty and love for our country."

Thomas McClure is an illustrator and designer whose most recent work is in the production and conceptual illustration for feature films. The opinions expressed in these cartoons are his own.

The 2016 election has been a wild ride, a presidential campaign unlike anything the nation has seen before.

It's stunning to consider: We first met the motley cast of Republican and Democratic candidates at the first debate in the summer -- of 2015!

Since then, voters have endured an interminable season of stunts, insults, character assassination, scandals, half-truths and outright lies. Now the field is winnowed to two major party candidates, who will face each other for the third and final debate this week.

An exhausted America is left to contemplate: How did we get here?

Early this year I started drawing cartoons of the campaign. It was the first time I'd tried political cartooning.

I draw because I don't write and have limited verbal skills. My background is in art, architecture, advertising, design and movies.

Why did I venture into the world of political comment and caricature assassination? Two reasons: my addiction to cable news, and the insanity that passes for political campaigning this season. Not since my innocence was shattered by the Watergate hearings have I been as shocked by the stupidity that reverberates from our media.

I found myself ranting uncontrollably at my TV and continuing the rant on the phone to my friends. My cats were starting to get nervous and my friends were not returning my calls.

A bald eagle hunts from my property daily. His morning chattering, which I normally found pleasant, suddenly sounded mournful and strident, reminding me of the plight of our nation.

This could not go on. My health was suffering. In desperation I took my frustration to the drawing board.

The therapeutic value of this action was amazing.

The ideas flowed forth. The source was inexhaustible. Donald Trump was enough to keep me going all by himself. He seemed to personify everything the world dislikes about the United States. He truly is the Ugliest American.

As I found my voice, I started to send these regurgitations to my friends. The response was encouraging so I posted a few on Facebook. The feedback was amazing. I started hearing from people I had lost touch with years ago.

Some said they had always thought I had a unique point of view, while others suggested that it was not so much that I marched to a different drummer but that I had no rhythm.

I'll let you decide. These are my musings. Enjoy. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
(CNN) One of my earliest memories is sitting on my grandfather's shoulders, waving a flag as our astronauts returned to Hawaii. This was years before we'd set foot on the moon. Decades before we'd land a rover on Mars. A generation before photos from the International Space Station would show up in our social media feeds.

I still have the same sense of wonder about our space program that I did as a child. It represents an essential part of our character -- curiosity and exploration, innovation and ingenuity, pushing the boundaries of what's possible and doing it before anybody else. The space race we won not only contributed immeasurably important technological and medical advances, but it also inspired a new generation of scientists and engineers with the right stuff to keep America on the cutting edge.

That's one of the reasons why, in my first address as President to the American people, I vowed to return science to its rightful place. In our first few months, my administration made the largest single investment in basic research in our history, and I went to the Kennedy Space Center to call for reimagining and reinvigorating our space program to explore more of our solar system and look deeper into the universe than ever.

In the years since, we've revitalized technology innovation at NASA, extended the life of the International Space Station, and helped American companies create private-sector jobs by capitalizing on the untapped potential of the space industry.

Last year alone, NASA discovered flowing water on Mars and evidence of ice on one of Jupiter's moons, and we mapped Pluto -- more than 3 billion miles away -- in high-resolution. Our space telescopes revealed additional Earth-like planets orbiting distant stars, and we're pursuing new missions to interact with asteroids, which will help us learn how to protect the Earth from the threat of colliding with one while also teaching us about the origins of life on Earth. We've flown by every planet in the solar system -- something no other nation can say. And we continue to drive down the cost of space exploration for taxpayers.

This week, we'll convene some of America's leading scientists, engineers, innovators and students in Pittsburgh to dream up ways to build on our progress and find the next frontiers. Just five years ago, US companies were shut out of the global commercial launch market. Today, thanks to groundwork laid by the men and women of NASA, they own more than a third of it. More than 1,000 companies across nearly all 50 states are working on private space initiatives.

We have set a clear goal vital to the next chapter of America's story in space: sending humans to Mars by the 2030s and returning them safely to Earth, with the ultimate ambition to one day remain there for an extended time. Getting to Mars will require continued cooperation between government and private innovators, and we're already well on our way. Within the next two years, private companies will for the first time send astronauts to the International Space Station.

The next step is to reach beyond the bounds of Earth's orbit. I'm excited to announce that we are working with our commercial partners to build new habitats that can sustain and transport astronauts on long-duration missions in deep space. These missions will teach us how humans can live far from Earth -- something we'll need for the long journey to Mars.

The reporter who covered the moon landing for The New York Times, John Noble Wilford, later wrote that Mars tugs at our imagination "with a force mightier than gravity." Getting there will take a giant leap. But the first, small steps happen when our students -- the Mars generation -- walk into their classrooms each day. Scientific discovery doesn't happen with the flip of a switch; it takes years of testing, patience and a national commitment to education.

President Eisenhower knew this: In 1958, he devoted great resources to science and math education around the same time he created NASA. And it's why I'm proud that we've passed important milestones in STEM education. For the first time, more than 100,000 engineers are graduating from American schools every year, and we're on track to accomplish my goal of training 100,000 excellent new STEM teachers in a decade.

When our Apollo astronauts looked back from space, they realized that while their mission was to explore the moon, they had "in fact discovered the Earth." If we make our leadership in space even stronger in this century than it was in the last, we won't just benefit from related advances in energy, medicine, agriculture and artificial intelligence, we'll benefit from a better understanding of our environment and ourselves.

Someday, I hope to hoist my own grandchildren onto my shoulders. We'll still look to the stars in wonder, as humans have since the beginning of time. But instead of eagerly awaiting the return of our intrepid explorers, we'll know that because of the choices we make now, they've gone to space not just to visit, but to stay -- and in doing so, to make our lives better here on Earth. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Michelle Obama is the first lady of the United States. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. Watch CNN Films' "We Will Rise: Michelle Obama's Mission to Educate Girls Around the World" on CNNgo.

Neither of my parents and hardly anyone in the neighborhood where I grew up went to college. But thanks to a lot of hard work and plenty of financial aid, I had the opportunity to attend some of the finest universities in this country. That education opened so many doors and gave me the confidence to pursue my ambitions and have a voice in the world.

For me, education was power.

And a few years ago, when I had the honor of meeting Malala Yousafzai , who was shot in the head just for trying to go to school, this issue got really personal for me. I saw that the terrorists who nearly killed her were trying to silence her voice, snuff out her ambitions, and take away her power.

That's why I decided to work on global girls' education as first lady: because right now, there are tens of millions of girls like Malala in every corner of the globe who are not in school -- girls who are so bright, hardworking and hungry to learn. And that's really the mission of the Let Girls Learn initiative we launched last year: It's a global effort to give these girls the education they need to fulfill their potential and lift up their families, communities and countries.

Now, as first lady, I have no budget of my own for programs, and I have no authority to make or pass laws. That's why, when we first launched Let Girls Learn, many folks doubted that we could make a real impact on this global issue.

But over the past year and a half, we've established partnerships with some of the world's largest companies and organizations that are committing money, resources and expertise. We're collaborating with countries like Canada, Mexico and the Nordic countries on girls' education efforts. Countries like Japan, South Korea, and the United Kingdom have collectively pledged nearly $600 million.

The United States is investing over a billion dollars through new and ongoing efforts and running Let Girls Learn programs in more than 50 countries. The World Bank Group will be investing $2.5 billion over the next five years. And through social media campaigns, Let Girls Learn has rallied people across America and across the globe to step up and be champions for girls worldwide.

All this is happening because time and again, whether it's a head of state, a corporate CEO, or a 15-year-old girl here in the United States, when people hear the stories of girls who aren't in school, they want to help.

That's why CNN's new film on global girls' education, "We Will Rise," airing for the first time this week, is so critically important -- because it tells these girls' stories.

This powerful film chronicles the lives of some of the girls I visited this past summer in Liberia and Morocco, two countries in Africa where many girls struggle to get an education. I was joined in my travels by the actors and activists Meryl Streep and Freida Pinto , who are also passionate about girls' education, as well as CNN anchor Isha Sesay

JUST WATCHED Why young girls in Morocco are missing school Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Why young girls in Morocco are missing school 01:48

Together, we sat down with girls in both countries to discuss the barriers they face and the dreams they hold for their futures. Like so many girls around the world, many of these girls come from families struggling with poverty. Some endure dangerous commutes to and from school each day. Others face cultural pressures to drop out, marry young and start having children of their own.

But these girls have big plans for their lives. They want to attend college and become doctors, teachers, engineers, entrepreneurs; and day after day, they do whatever it takes to get the education they need to fulfill their dreams. They get up before dawn, and spend hours harvesting crops, cooking for their families and tending to their younger siblings before heading to class.

(CNN) Thirty-five years ago, alert physicians in the United States spotted a new disease, caused by a virus that had been in circulation, unnoticed, for decades in people, and millennia in monkeys.

The virus had hit pay dirt, racing through the gay sexual revolution where one man might have sex with 30 other men a year, giving the virus exponential rates of infection

Over time, the virus' transmission shifted, especially in Africa, from rare cases of monkey-to-human transmission to general heterosexual spread, with women today five times more likely to be newly infected compared to men, thanks to sexual cultures that favor male promiscuity.

That was HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, which currently infects more than 37 million people living all over the world.

A key lesson of AIDS is that a virus—in HIV's case, infecting African monkeys—might pass rarely, but repeatedly, to human beings for decades before arriving in a context of epidemic potential.

Adapting to new modes of transmission and targeting novel species, the microbe can exist for thousands of years before beginning to achieve previously unimaginable feats, with devastating impact.

Now the world is facing a virus that seems poised to make a similar leap: the Zika virus.

Like HIV, Zika originated in central Africa, very rarely infecting human beings, and circulating among rainforest primates. Unlike HIV, Zika had the ability to fly, carried by Aedes aegypti mosquitoes from one monkey or human, to another.

Since reaching Brazil in 2013, where it has spread explosively over the last 12 months, Zika has demonstrated capabilities not seen, or extremely rarely noted, with any other insect-carried microbes.

Most worrying, Zika has shed its mosquito transport dependency, becoming an efficient resident of human semen , and spread from male-to-female (and male-to-male) via sexual intercourse.

This week researchers reported finding Zika in a woman's vagina, noting that, "the very presence in the female genital tract [implies] that sexual transmission from women to men could occur." And barely had the ink dried on that report when the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced today that a woman who traveled in a Zika-hit country, who got infected through a mosquito bite, has passed the virus onto her male sexual partner in New York City, marking the first documented case of female to male sexual transmission in the U.S. (and the 14th documented sexual transmission in the U.S. overall).

If Zika finds its way into an especially sexually active community, it could well become a threat not only in America's southern, mosquito-infested states, but anywhere in the world.

Like HIV, the Zika virus would likely find its way into populations that feel discriminated against by the general population, and take its toll disproportionately among teenage girls and young women.

And while politicians play partisan games with funding on Capitol Hill, government and philanthropic donors ignore the World Health Organization's pleas for a measly $122 million to fight it, and state health agencies scramble to find anti-mosquito resources, the virus is spreading in new ways , causing an ever-widening range of dangerous birth defects and human illnesses.

"I am concerned that the goose is cooked. This funding is done. It's not coming to us," Dr. Umair Shah, a public health official in Harris Country, Texas told NBC News . "We cannot spray our way out of this situation," Shah added, saying pesticides won't be enough to stop Zika at this late date in the American South.

The lingering Ebola epidemic in West Africa offers lessons on the difficulty of stopping a virus that takes on sexual transmission and can abide in semen for weeks after a man has recovered from the disease. Several times in 2015 and 2016, Ebola seemed to have been eradicated from Guinea, Sierra Leone or Liberia, only to reemerge via sexual transmission

The statistics on Zika as a sexually transmitted disease are sobering. According to the World Health Organization , the Zika virus has emerged in 48 countries since Brazil sounded the alarm in October 2015.

Four of those countries have active mosquito-borne spread of the virus underway now, and eleven of them—including the United States—have documented sexual transmission of the virus. Two Americans have died of Zika , one in Puerto Rico and the other in Utah. They were among the 1,132 travel-related Zika cases documented in the United States. Among the 50 states, Florida has been hardest hit to date, with 263 confirmed cases, 43 of them pregnant women, followed by Texas.

Politics should not trump biology

"No pregnant women should have to worry that her baby will develop brain damage because she was bitten once by a mosquito," a petition to Congress from the March of Dimes states. "It's an outrage that Congress has failed to give states and localities the resources they need to protect pregnant women and babies from Zika virus."

The Zika funding stalemate on Capitol Hill might well result in an increase in the numbers of abortions in the United States this year—an ironic and tragic outcome of a political squabble that features, among other disputes, Democrats' objection to House Republicans' inclusion of anti-Planned Parenthood language in the GOP's Zika bill

In Latin American countries hard hit by the virus, abortion rates have soared this year by as much as 108%, which research suggests is due largely to women who feared carrying a "Zika baby" but had no access to tests that could confirm the healthy viability of their fetus. Such tests don't exist: American women have no special advantage in the Zika fight, despite the greater wealth of the United States.

In a few days, the Republican Party will gather for its national convention in Cleveland, Ohio—a metropolis that last year ranked in the top twenty most mosquito-infested cities in the United States. At the end of this week, Congress will shut down for the summer, and the politicians will not return to hammer out new agreements until September 6.

Barring a remarkable compromise, the politicians will exit Washington on Friday, leaving funding for Zika prevention and research in the lurch , with the White House, Senate, and House each offering radically different funding proposals, none of which will materialize as money for research.

Meanwhile, in all tiers of public health across America, scientists and officials are scrambling to rob other budgets in order to finance research and mosquito control measures. At local levels, this ironically means things like sexually-transmitted diseases (STDs) programs are losing money, so that counties can hire mosquito abatement experts.

At the federal level, the remaining Ebola programs are seeing their budgets pilfered to provide temporary Zika funds, and a range of basic science research initiatives at the National Institutes of Health are on hold , their funds diverted to efforts to understand, diagnose, treat and vaccinate against Zika.

Vital questions about Zika, especially as a sexually transmitted disease linked to birth defects, are going unanswered, thanks to the research funding gap.

Can the world's blood supply be cleansed of Zika risk with transfusion?

How likely is it that sexual transmission could dominate spread of Zika in the United States?

How long can Zika survive in semen and cause infections?

How does the virus get through the placenta to infect the developing fetus?

Is it possible to create a 100% reliable fetal test for Zika infection and brain damage that can be used to guide decisions regarding pregnancy termination?

Are the risks greater in a particular stage of pregnancy?

Why aren't sonograms reliably identifying microcephaly babies in utero?

Can a mother give birth to Zika-damaged babies if she never had symptoms of the disease?

Are there ways that women can protect themselves and carry babies to term, short of the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommendation to delay pregnancies altogether?

How can a potential Zika vaccine be safely tested on pregnant women and their babies

In the absence of answers to these and other Zika questions, women are compelled to make dire decisions, including opting for abortions

Is Zika becoming a sexually transmitted disease?

While HIV and Ebola offer potential roadmaps for how this might happen, it's still an open question. Researchers in Brazil took a deep dive into the country's data for dengue, a virus spread by the same Aedes aegypti mosquitoes as carry Zika, analyzing of the disease's diagnoses in 2013, 2015, and early 2016.

They paid special attention to the distribution of dengue by age and gender. And they did the same for Zika cases in the country over 2015 and 2016. If all Zika cases were due to mosquito bites, the demographic distribution of dengue and Zika should match. But that's not what they found

Instead, 90% more Zika cases were registered among women, compared to the female rates for dengue.

Neighboring Colombia has also seen far more Zika in females, with young women accounting for two-thirds of the 65,726 cases diagnosed by mid-April 2016.

Researchers note that though the infection rate was similar in very young children of both genders, "the incidence was significantly higher among female patients than among male patients in all other age groups."

Critics charge that both the Brazilian and Colombian studies may simply reflect the greater fear women have about exposure to Zika during pregnancy, prompting more of them to seek medical care. The researchers disagree, insisting that the higher rates of diagnosed Zika are seen in young women, whether or not they are pregnant or are trying to conceive.

One reason young women may be at higher risk is that they are having more sex with male partners whose semen may remain Zika-contaminated and infectious for months

Such a pronounced gender difference wasn't seen in the Zika outbreaks in Pacific Island nations between 1990 and 2013, but there have been subtle genetic changes in the virus since its arrival in the Americas. Are these mutations relevant to sexual transmission? That is another research question scientists would like to answer, if Congress ever provides funding.

At the end of June, frustrated scientists at the NIH decided to charge ahead with pregnancy and sexual research, despite congressional gridlock, by putting numerous other disease studies on temporary hold.

A large study, tracking women over time in the United States, Puerto Rico, and Brazil, has begun enrolling volunteers. "We are going out on a limb, but we have to," Dr. Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH's Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told Reuters . "We can't say we're going to wait until we get all the money."

When microbes gain capacity to be sexually transmitted, they rarely disappear from the human population group in which they emerged.

In 2008, for instance, physicians in San Francisco noticed that drug-resistant Staphylococcus, MRSA, was far more prevalent among gay men compared to any other demographic group; the bacterial disease had become a STD , soon surfacing among gay men in Boston and New York.

In 2013, European researchers discovered that a virulent form of the bacterium that causes meningitis was spreading sexually among gay men. By 2015, gay men were dying from the new STD, and this year, public health officials all over the United States are begging gay men to get vaccinated as meningitis outbreaks surface nationwide.

How to prevent a sexually transmitted Zika catastrophe?

So what can we do to stave off a similarly catastrophic turn of events with the Zika virus? According to the CDC , 287 pregnant women living in the United States were diagnosed as Zika-infected by June 23, and another 250 in U.S. territories. There is no reliable test that can tell these 537 women whether or not the virus has passed to their fetus, gnawing away at their tiny, developing brains. In the United States and beyond, women especially are in desperate need of such a test.

A recent poll conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that two-thirds of Americans have heard of Zika, which means an alarming third of the population knows nothing about the disease, and is unlikely to take precautions against infection.

Fewer still—less than half—were aware that Zika could be passed sexually. In the absence of such knowledge, sexually active Americans are unlikely to use condoms.

Around the world, intriguing puzzles abound. Jacqueline Silva de Oliveira lives in Santos, Brazil, where she contracted Zika during her pregnancy—either via a mosquito or sexually, it is not known—and gave birth to twins in February.

Today, Lucas is a healthy, happy infant, but his twin sister, Laura, suffers in agonizing pain thanks to Zika microcephaly -- which slaughters brain cells and results in complete remodeling of the brain in development.

The Brazilian government is monitoring six such sets of twins , discordant for Zika microcephaly, in hopes of learning how the virus infects (or doesn't infect) fetuses.

In France , a healthy couple trying to have children sought in vitro fertilization. The clinic assisting them tested their blood and his semen for various infections, including Zika: they were fine.

The couple took a holiday in the Caribbean nation of Martinique, returned to France, and underwent more tests. The man's blood was free of Zika, but about a month after they were back in France, the woman became infected. Examination of her partner's semen revealed Zika. Neither of them ever had symptoms of illness, nor felt any reason to avoid sex or use condoms, as they were a married couple trying to have a baby.

Here at home, time is running out. Researchers desperately need funding to provide the tools required to forestall a sexually transmitted Zika epidemic in the United States.

In the absence of those tools, women will make difficult choices, deferring pregnancies for months, perhaps years, and seeking abortions.

The stalemate on Capitol Hill may actually increase the likelihood that more American babies will be born with terrible malformations and neurological deficits. And, equally horribly, that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of couples will seek abortions based on suspicion of Zika infection, possibly terminating some healthy pregnancies. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Story highlights Orlando mass killing fits grim pattern of homegrown terrorism, writes Peter Bergen

Since 9/11, every attack on U.S. soil was carried out by citizen or legal permanent resident, he writes

Peter Bergen is CNN's national security analyst, a vice president at New America and a professor of practice at Arizona State University. He is the author of the new book "United States of Jihad: Investigating America's Homegrown Terrorists."

(CNN) The mass killing in Orlando this weekend fits a grim pattern: Every lethal terrorist attack in the United States in the past decade and a half has been carried out by American citizens or legal permanent residents, operating either as lone wolves or in pairs, who have no formal connections or training from terrorist organizations such as al Qaeda or ISIS.

Because 9/11 was carried out by 19 Arab foreign-born terrorists, many Americans may think that terrorist attacks in the United States are carried out by foreigners, rather than by U.S. citizens.

But Omar Mateen, who on Sunday carried out the deadliest terrorist attack in the United States since 9/11, is an American citizen who was born in New York to parents who immigrated to the United States from Afghanistan.

In fact, since 9/11, a plot which was directed by al Qaeda from Afghanistan and involved only foreign operatives, the real terror threat in the United States has been American citizens or legal permanent residents such as the Tsarnaev brothers, who carried out the Boston Marathon bombings in 2013, and Nidal Hasan, the U.S. Army major who killed 13 at Fort Hood, Texas, four years earlier.

In other ways, Mateen is also typical of jihadist terrorists in the States. He was on the radar of the FBI as a possible militant, just as Tamerlan Tsarnaev, who was investigated by the bureau because of a tip from the Russian government in 2011 that he might be a militant.

Mel Robbins is a CNN commentator, legal analyst, best-selling author and keynote speaker. In 2014, she was named outstanding news talk-radio host by the Gracie Awards. This commentary has been updated since its publication. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

(CNN) I just finished reading one of the most powerful things I've ever seen.

If you've already seen it, you likely feel the same way:

It is riveting. It's raw. I hung on every single word.

It is the 12-page victim impact statement written by a woman who was raped in January 2015 on the Stanford University campus after a night of drinking at a party.

The power of her words stood in stark contrast to those of the father of her attacker. He, too, wrote a letter to the judge who held his son's fate in his hands. It is deeply disturbing in its plainspoken and clueless banality, and tells you everything you need to know about why the crime of rape so frequently goes unpunished in America.

This is a case with no ambiguity. There were witnesses to her attack: two male Stanford students were riding their bikes across campus when they spotted Brock Allen Turner on top of a woman who wasn't moving. These men are among the heroes in her heartbreakingly sad story.

They chased him, tackled him and held him until the police came. The victim had no memory of the rape. She was unconscious behind a dumpster when Turner assaulted her. His defense: she consented.

He was convicted of all three felony accounts and will register as a sex offender. He faced 14 years in prison, and will only serve six months. (update: Turner was released from jail Friday after serving 3 months of his sentence.)

At the sentencing, the victim read her letter aloud and addressed Turner directly. In it, she gives a harrowing description of her rape and a jaw-dropping account of its aftermath. Reading it will expose you to the horror every rape victim faces as she is retraumatized over and over while society seeks "justice" against her rapist.

I'm a parent. I was so moved that I printed out a copy. I wanted my family to read it. Not just our two daughters, but my husband and our son.

That's who should be reading this letter. Give it to your sons, your brothers and your mates.

If anything is going to change the culture of rape in our society, it will be a turnaround led by men like the two guys who stopped it that night and the Santa Clara county district attorney, Jeff Rosen, who called the sentence "unjust."

Rosen added that "the fact that the defendant preyed upon an intoxicated stranger on a college campus should not be viewed as less serious than if he assaulted an intoxicated stranger in downtown Palo Alto... Campus rape is no different than off-campus rape. Rape is rape."

We women know all too well about victim blaming, alcohol as an excuse for assault. It's not alcohol that's raping women; it is men.

Our sons, all the young men in our lives need to be told: Alcohol is never an excuse

As the victim wrote: "Is it a factor? Yes. But alcohol was not the one who stripped me, fingered me, had my head dragging against the ground, with me almost fully naked."

It's black and white: If a woman is drunk, she can't consent.

After hearing from the victim, the judge also considered the appalling letter from the rapist's father, Dan Turner.

In it, he pleads with the judge for leniency for his son, explaining that his son should not have to go to prison for "20 minutes of action." The father describes how "this" has affected his son negatively—he has lost his appetite and doesn't like eating "ribeye steak" anymore.

JUST WATCHED Did Brock Turner take a photo of rape victim? Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Did Brock Turner take a photo of rape victim? 03:45

He writes, "The fact that he now has to register as a sexual offender for the rest of his life forever alters where he can live, visit, work, and interact with people and organization." He argues that his son's "life will never be the one that he dreamed about and worked so hard to achieve."

In the end, the judge sentenced Turner to six months in county prison, saying a harsher penalty would have a "severe impact" on the aspiring athlete. His sentence includes probation and his name in a sex offender registry.

That last part isn't to punish Turner -- it's to protect us all from him. You know why he has to register as a sexual offender? It's because he committed a sexual crime.

Even after the trial. Even after the conviction, there is still denial -- Turner's dad writing that his son has "never been violent to anyone including the night of" the crime! Twelve jurors believed otherwise. And now the Turners will appeal.

Social media has been rightfully ablaze. The most compelling tweet I have seen is this one by Twitter user Jez Kemp, who edited the dad's letter to highlight the victim-blaming, swapping in female pronouns to illuminate the issue. Take a look:

Rape isn't a story about alcohol. It's one of choices. And every man has a choice. To rape or not. To rescue or ignore. To deliver justice or give someone a slap on the wrist.

The only thing that will change this is awareness by men. The good guys. That's why I'm asking you to share this letter with your sons, your brothers and your friends. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
John D. Sutter is a columnist for CNN Opinion who focuses on climate change and social justice. Follow him on Snapchat , Facebook and email . The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.

Atlanta (CNN) Before I launch into the argument for making all restrooms in the United States gender neutral -- that is, removing "men's" and "women's" labels -- I want to show you a photo.

This is James Parker Sheffield.

Now a truly ridiculous question: Which restroom do you think he should use?

Men's or women's?

In the United States at the moment, the legal answer depends on location. If Sheffield is in North Carolina, it's illegal for him to use a public men's restroom. Since he's a transgender man -- his birth certificate has an "F" on it -- he has to use the women's.

If he's at home in Atlanta, he can use the men's.

"It's now the law for me to share a restroom with your wife," Sheffield wrote on Twitter along with his selfie. He posted that message in March, only hours after North Carolina passed a law making it illegal for transgender people to use public restrooms that correspond with their true gender identities.

As it's written, Sheffield would have to use the lady's room or break the law.

That's absurd, as the selfie and tweet make clear. Sheffield is a 36-year-old man who lives in Decatur, Georgia. He has a scruffy beard and a receding hairline, which he jokingly calls a "reverse fade." If he walked into a lady's restroom he'd likely be met with stares or screams or worse.

But you know what else is absurd? The idea that Sheffield -- or anyone else -- should have to choose a male or female restroom at all. And, beyond that, that any of us would feel entitled to decide someone else's gender for them -- and, consequently, where they can and can't pee.

This isn't a binary gender world. People don't fit neatly into the "M" and "F" boxes. It's time our public restrooms reflected that. The fairest way to do so is to desegregate restrooms by sex, and that means eliminating the men's and women's rooms in favor of "all gender" restrooms.

Think that's an overreaction? Take a quick look at the history of bathroom politics in the United States. We've tried time and again to control who we sit and stand next to at the toilet.

In the 1960s, black civil rights activists were killed for trying to use "whites only" bathrooms. In the 1980s, gay men were harassed because the public wrongly assumed they could catch HIV-AIDS from a toilet. (AIDS was viewed then as a gay man's disease). Restrooms weren't required to be accessible to people with wheelchairs until the Americans with Disabilities act of 1990. And now, some cities and states are trying to keep transgender people out.

The only justification is bigotry and ignorance.

You might think that allowing a transgender person to use the restroom of their choice is a workable solution. It's a first step. But Sheffield and others who don't conform to gender norms face discrimination even when they're legally allowed to choose which restroom to use.

Seventy percent of transgender people surveyed in Washington, for example, a city with progressive laws allowing people to use either restroom, reported "verbal harassment, assault and being denied access to public restrooms" because of their identities, according to a report from the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles . Further, 54% reported medical problems "like dehydration, urinary tract infections, kidney infections and other kidney problems" because they avoided using restrooms entirely.

Sheffield told me he plans his days around where he can and can't pee.

"I almost never go to the restroom in a place I haven't been at least once before," he told me. He cuts appointments short and avoids going out simply to avoid peeing in public. Sometimes he'll find the one stall in a men's room is occupied, or out of order. Other times he sits on the toilet for longer than necessary because he worries it's suspicious a man would sit down to urinate.

"It's not a good feeling to be a grown-up and wondering, 'Am I going to make it to a restroom on time -- and how do you explain it if you don't,'" he said.

Such fears apply not only to transgender people but also those who don't meet our rigid gender norms. In 2013, I met a female middle school student in Mississippi , for example, who told me her teachers wouldn't let her use the girl's restroom because she had short hair and wore hoodies. She looked too boyish.

Gendered restrooms support these biases.

"We need a restroom revolution in this country," said Kathryn Anthony, an architecture professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.

I agree. And there are simple places to start. Restaurants and small businesses with two single-unit restrooms simply can paint over the "M" and "W" on their doors and -- ba-da-bing! -- they're gender inclusive. No one's harmed as long as we men stop peeing on the toilet seat.

Philadelphia recently made that concept law for single-stall bathrooms. Other governments and businesses should follow. (And if you're a business that is considering this sort of move, please send me a tweet ).

Then, bigger leaps: The International Building Code should suggest all-gender restrooms become the norm, or at least be included, in larger businesses and public establishments. (That idea comes from Terry Kogan, a law professor at the University of Utah.)

City, state and federal governments also could legislate these restrooms into existence, too.

It won't happen immediately, but new construction and renovations could be subject to our updated understanding of which types of bathrooms are safest for everyone. That's the precedent set by the Americans with Disabilities Act, Kogan said.

Harvey Molotch, a professor of sociology at New York University and co-editor of the book "Toilet: public restrooms and the politics of sharing," outlined for me what he considers to be the Holy Grail of restrooms. Walk in and you'd see a long line of private toilet stalls, with floor-to-ceiling doors. On the other side would be a row of communal sinks. Anyone is free to use any stall -- and there might be a row of urinals tucked away somewhere to the side.

The urinals could be left out of some restrooms, but they should be kept when possible, Molotch said, because they're much more water-efficient than sit-down toilets.

All this sounds wildly inoffensive to me.

And it's already happening.

The Cooper Union, a college in New York, announced on March 18 that it is removing gender identification from restrooms on campus and opening single-occupancy toilets up for anyone's use. "We have always been ahead of our time and we must continue being leaders on issues of social justice," Bill Mea, acting president, wrote in an email to the campus

The Urban Justice Center, also in New York, made a similar move a decade ago.

"I'm delighted to be able to share that our experiences have been wholly positive," the center's executive director, Doug Lasdon, and a development associate, Hugh Ryan, wrote in a recent op-ed in the Washington Post . "To this day, we have not received a single complaint. Not one in a decade. Nor have any incidents of violence or harassment been reported."

There's little counterargument other that bias and squeamishness.

Sheffield, the transgender man in Georgia, doesn't expect the all-gender restroom revolution to occur anytime soon. "If we could go to sleep tonight and wake up and all the bathrooms were gender neutral -- great! But it's not practical," he said. "It's not going to happen that way."

In the meantime, he said, a little courteousness would help.

"We can't hold it," he said. "Trans people have to pee multiple times a day, just like everyone else."

Currently, there are only two places Sheffield feels comfortable peeing.

One's at home.

The other's at work.

And that's because it's labeled "all gender restroom." <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Story highlights Former Toronto mayor Rob Ford died of cancer after a widely publicized struggle with drug and alcohol addiction

Patrick Krill: Why do we empathize with the sufferer of one disease, cancer, while people mocked him for his addiction, which is another disease

Patrick R. Krill is a licensed attorney, board certified alcohol and drug counselor, author and advocate. He is the director of the Legal Professionals Program at the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.

(CNN) "Rob Ford fought cancer with courage and determination. My condolences and best wishes to the Ford family today". --Justin Trudeau, Prime Minister of Canada, via Twitter.

Patrick R. Krill

As is now customary with the passing of public figures, social media exploded with condolences for the family of the late Mayor Rob Ford on Tuesday, making it clear that a man once the subject of merciless ridicule was now being afforded a level of sympathy and kindness unfathomable just a few short years ago.

Across the Internet and media, punchlines have largely been replaced by dignified tributes, and crude caricatures by staid, objective reporting. Why? Because Rob Ford, alive as an alcoholic, was apparently less deserving of compassion and understanding than Rob Ford, now dead from cancer.

True, the fond remembrances and generous consolations are heartening, refreshing expressions of decency towards a family in grieving, and yes, they should be acknowledged and welcomed as such. To be clear, however, they are also the indisputable byproduct of the type of image makeover nobody wants — a cancer diagnosis.

Fueling Ford's trajectory from viciously mocked to politely mourned, his cancer demonstrated how malleable our emotional responses are in light of our moralizations. Rob Ford was, after all, a man who suffered from two life-threatening diseases but garnered sympathy for only one. Perhaps that dichotomy is worth us, as a society, examining.

Michael D'Antonio is the author of the new book "Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success" (St. Martin's Press). The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.

(CNN) Having long ago committed himself to the proposition that there is no such thing as too much press, Donald Trump may be the most photographed, filmed and quoted man of our time.

Add his own words, offered in books, speeches, Facebook posts and Tweets, and you might conclude that there's little left for this man to share.

But think again. What if all those words were intended, not to reveal, but conceal? What if Trump talks so much because he wants to control the conversation?

Now that Trump is the GOP's presumptive nominee for president, he'll face more intense scrutiny about his many claims to personal success, his political beliefs, his temperament and his character. In each case, the public record is filled with incidents and examples, but a skeptic finds little clarity.

This state of affairs may suffice for anyone buying a steak or an apartment from Trump the salesman, but voters contemplating Trump the candidate for president deserve better answers to the lingering questions.

Here they are:

What is Trump's temperament?

TV audiences have been treated to more than 100 episodes of Trump's reality TV shows "The Apprentice" and "Celebrity Apprentice." The Trump depicted on air is the product of so much editing and consulting by producers and directors that it is no better than a cartoon. More useful is the cumulative Trump record, which includes as many negatives as positives.

To Trump's credit, he has shown himself to be resilient, coming back from failures that would have sent less confident men and women into business exile. Most notable, of course, is the crisis he experienced in the early 1990s when he was unable to pay personal and corporate debts in the neighborhood of $3.4 billion

Trump is also a nimble entrepreneur, who looks for opportunities and seizes them decisively. Witness his ability to deal in real estate, entertainment and retail merchandising, all at the same time.

On the other side of the ledger, open questions remain about his consistent record of cruelty and excess when dealing with critics and competitors. Trump's code begins with the belief that he's justified in "hitting back ten times harder" whenever he's offended. If our presidents believed in this approach, America would have engaged in shooting wars with untold numbers of countries that have, in recent decades, committed transgressions against the United States.

Would Trump have hit back 10 times harder when North Korea detained the spy ship Pueblo? What about the downing of Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 over the territory of our ally Ukraine. U.S. intelligence indicates a Russia missile likely was responsible. Would Trump have responded by downing 10 Aeroflot planes?

We can ask additional questions about Trump's penchant for bullying. In some cases this trait has shown itself in mere words, as he has attempted to humiliate, disparage and marginalize others. In other instances he has sought to force innocent landowners off their properties to make way for his developments. This willingness to use any means necessary to get what he wants raises serious concern about Trump's ability to manage America's affairs in a complex world.

What does Trump believe?

More than any political figure in modern times, Trump represents an ideological puzzle. Although he now claims the conservative Republican mantle, he has often associated himself with liberal and Democratic Party ideas. In 1999 he told CNN, "I've actually been an activist Democrat and Republican."

In the past, Trump said he is "totally pro-choice." Now he is against abortion rights, recently musing about punishing women who might violate a ban on the procedure.

In the past, Trump was in favor of levying a big tax on the rich , himself included, to pay down the federal deficit. Like banks, rich people have the money, and Trump reasoned that they could afford to help the country out. Today, Trump is in favor of big tax cuts for the wealthy.

In 2000 Trump proposed banning private ownership of assault weapons and increasing the waiting period for the purchase of guns. In the current campaign he has declared himself to be an ardent defender of gun rights, and he has even proposed eliminating gun-free zones near schools.

The list of Trump flip-flops is long and includes his positions on the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and his regard for Hillary Clinton's performance as secretary of state. Voters, especially those conservatives who want a clear sense of what their standard-bearer will do as president, deserve explanations for these shifts.

How rich is he?

Throughout his life Trump has cited his wealth as evidence of his excellence but without offering verifiable proof of his claims. In the 1970s he cruised Manhattan in a chauffeured limousine and gave others the impression that he was in control of the $200 million fortune amassed by his father.

In the 1980s, when he first made it onto the Forbes magazine list of America's wealthiest men and women, Trump complained often and loudly about how his holdings were underestimated. More recently he said he is worth some $10 billion.

The record produced by those who have looked closely at Trump's finances raises many questions. Writer Wayne Barrett reported in the 1980s that Trump's income as of 1978 was less than $100,000. In the 1993 biography of Trump called "Lost Tycoon," Harry Hurt III noted that during his divorce from his first wife, Ivana, her attorneys found that Trump had never been worth the billions of dollars he claimed. Hurt also reported that in March 1992, Trump's own lawyers said he could not afford to pay Ivana even half of the $20 million he had offered as a settlement.

More recently doubts about his wealth arose in 2005 when journalist Tim O'Brien wrote that Trump was probably worth between $150 million and $250 million. For a man who reveled in his image as a billionaire, O'Brien's estimate was too much to bear. Trump sued. The case was dismissed by the trial judge. Trump appealed. He lost

Were Trump a more circumspect and well-mannered man, who never bragged about how rich he is, his wealth would be less of an issue. However Trump has made his fortune such an important part of his identity that voters deserve to know the truth. Many of the facts are contained in Trump's personal income tax filings, and it is now a campaign tradition for candidates to make these documents public. Clinton has made public all of her returns going back to 2000.

So far, Trump has refused to release his returns because, he says, he is undergoing an audit on returns filed in the last few years. Nothing in the law, or in federal regulations, would prohibit him from making the documents public now, but if he is uncomfortable with releasing those forms, he could simply match Clinton for those years that are settled.

Such a release would reassure the public that Trump is who he says he is -- a really rich man -- and allow a glimpse into other matters, including his charitable giving. It is a matter of conservative orthodoxy that the rich should be spared excessive taxation so they can support society freely with their philanthropy.

Is he a man of character?

Personality, which can be seen in a smile, heard in a glib remark or felt when viewing a performance, is not the most important measure of a man or woman. Many people with winning personalities are, in fact, hucksters, con men, manipulators and deceivers. In fact, the false signals flashed by well-practiced performers, including politicians, compel us to look for the signs of the character beneath the personality.

Experts in assessing character generally look for some traits such as autonomy and life purpose that Trump clearly possesses in abundance. But there are other areas of character , including positive relations with others, ethical behavior, empathy, honesty and humility where Trump would not achieve a very high score.

In his long and very public life, Trump has often shown he is willing to do things others consider wrong in order to get what he wants. This includes using a false identity to make claims about his success, carrying out a bitter divorce dispute in the tabloid press, criticizing the appearance of others and refusing to take the high road when offered the chance.

The most troubling aspect of Trump's character can be seen in his devotion to the so-called birther campaign that sought to delegitimize President Barack Obama. Despite all the evidence to the contrary, birthers led by Trump insisted that some mystery surrounded Obama's status as a citizen born in the United States.

Long after documents were produced to settle this falsely posed question, Trump continued to raise doubts and thus signal his allegiance to those who considered the President to be an unworthy "other." The racism latent in the birther movement was documented in a study by University of Delaware psychologist Eric Heyman, but the link to prejudice was always plain to see. Rather than stand against birtherism, Trump built a following by exploiting it.

In fact, one can find precedent for Trump's birtherism in his previous provocative statements about racially sensitive subjects. Other evidence of his character can be found in his selective use of facts, his tendency to inflame conflict rather than cool it and his devotion to self-promotion.

In the past Trump's character has been well-suited to his pursuit of success as he defines it. But as revealed thus far, it would disqualify him when it comes to the presidency. We can only hope Trump has something better to show and will do it when placed under the pressure of the coming campaign. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Story highlights The former senior adviser to President Obama recalls when Scalia asked for the appointment of a justice who is a stalwart liberal

Scalia knew Obama wouldn't pick a conservative, so he lobbied for a friend, Elena Kagan, Axelrod says

David Axelrod is CNN's senior political commentator and host of the podcast "The Axe Files." He was senior adviser to President Barack Obama and chief strategist for the 2008 and 2012 Obama campaigns. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.

(CNN) When the shocking news of Justice Antonin Scalia's passing hit Saturday night, my mind raced back to a White House Correspondents Association dinner seven years ago, when we were seated together.

David Axelrod

We bantered about my hometown of Chicago, where he had taught law before ascending to the bench. He opined on wine and music and generally lived up to his reputation as a man who told and enjoyed a good story.

And then our conversation took an unexpected turn.

Justice David Souter, Scalia's longtime colleague on the court, had just announced his retirement, creating a vacancy for President Obama to fill. Scalia figured that as senior adviser to the new president, I might have some influence on the decision -- or at least enough to pass along a message.

Michael D'Antonio is the author of the new book "Never Enough: Donald Trump and the Pursuit of Success" (St. Martin's Press) and is due to be a guest on "CNN Newsroom" Monday in the 10 a.m. hour. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.

(CNN) Given a straighforward opportunity to disavow the most dangerous brand of hatred in American history, the man who has declared, "I'm, like, a really smart person" couldn't do it.

"I don't know anything about what you're even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists," said Donald Trump in a response to CNN's Jake Tapper. "So I don't know. I don't know -- did he endorse me, or what's going on? Because I know nothing about David Duke; I know nothing about white supremacists."

The statement was classic Trump: a chopped salad made out of words. But the two parts were clear. "I know nothing about David Duke," he said. "I know nothing about white supremacists." (Trump later tweeted a disavowal.)

Every literate American adult, and certainly anyone running for president, must know that Duke is the former leader of the Ku Klux Klan and that white supremacists promote a violently racist ideology that plagues America.

The 1995 bombing of a federal building in Oklahoma City that killed 168 people, including 21 kids in a daycare center, was associated with if not inspired by white supremacy.

Since 9/11 white supremacists and other domestic terrorists have carried out more deadly attacks on American soil than Muslim extremists. It was a white supremacist who killed nine people at a Bible study at a Charleston, South Carolina, church last summer.

Concern about racist support for Trump arose last week when David Duke said on Facebook that he liked Trump's stands on certain issues and the way the candidate exposed "lies" perpetrated by the press and believed he will ensure "that White-Americans are allowed to preserve and promote their heritage and interests just as all other groups are allowed to do."

When first informed of Duke's support on Friday, Trump didn't have any trouble recognizing the name. "David Duke endorsed me?" he said. "OK, all right. I disavow, OK?" This makes sense, given the fact that Duke is notorious for hate-mongering and Trump named him years ago when he explained why he dropped out of the old Reform Party. Back then, and again on Friday, he knew who Duke was and seemed to recognize that he's political poison.

Trump's tune changed 48 hours before polls would open for Super Tuesday primaries, many of them in Southern states. Suddenly he was unable to place Duke's name and he didn't know a thing about the movement that keeps white racist extremism alive in America.

This from a fellow who is famous for recalling every detail of every deal he ever made and who never forgets those who offend him. If Duke was so bad that his presence drove Trump out of the Reform Party, it's unlikely he's forgotten him.

What's going on here? As someone who has spent many hours with Trump and devoted two years to piecing together the story of his life, I can tell you that Trump is not speaking out of ignorance. He is, as he says, "very smart," and he understands the effects of what he says. And he has been signaling where he stands when it comes to race for many years.

Before declaring for president, Trump spent much of the Obama presidency as the loudest voice of the "birthers" who repeatedly claimed that Barack Obama was born, not in Hawaii, as documents prove, but abroad. And therefore he was not a U.S. citizen, and not a legitimate president, in Trump's eyes.

Birtherism was a barely disguised effort to paint the first black president as an un-American other and was energized by racial animus. Trump played the game long after others disavowed it and went further, suggesting the President might not be a Christian, as he says, but perhaps instead a Muslim.

The insinuation, like Trump's suggestion that the truth about Obama's college years was somehow clouded, was a divisive kind of gutter politics.

Always comfortable going further than others, Trump was the man who responded to the arrest of five minority youths in the 1989 assault of a jogger in New York's Central Park with newspaper ads that said, "Bring Back The Death Penalty, Bring Back the Police."

When Trump and I discussed the five -- who were coerced into false confessions but eventually cleared of the crime -- he wasn't interested in discussing any part of it except for his belief that they were bad characters who deserved no consideration for the years they spent in prison.

The Trump record on race also includes the ridiculous assertion, made in a TV interview with Bryant Gumbel, that "A well-educated black has a tremendous advantage over a well-educated white in terms of the job market."

Trump also appeared as a witness at a congressional hearing on Indian casinos -- they were his competitors -- and said, "Organized crime is rampant on Indian reservations." He then offered his belief that Native Americans at the hearing where he spoke "don't look like Indians to me, and they don't look like Indians to Indians."

Trump's tendency to play with racial fire is a longstanding element of his style and personality. When he was a marginal political figure, no one dwelled much on this problem. But as he lurches toward the Republican nomination for president, it's important to understand that he always knows what he is saying and always acts with an intention in mind. He is, after all, a really smart person. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) It's too bad Superman is not running for president of the United States; this would have been his year. Americans, as we have discovered, are angry, frustrated, disillusioned -- and yearning for a savior.

This happened before, almost a century ago in Europe. It was a time of despair; a time when the old models didn't seem to be working, when the world was changing in confusing ways, and hyperconfident individuals proposed a way out by blaming scapegoats and promising exciting, almost miraculous change. The results proved catastrophic.

No, America is not 1930s Germany, not by a long shot. But the images of Europe after World War I keep coming to mind. The parallels are not precise, but we hear the echoes, see the shadows. We should heed the warnings.

Who would have thought that in the 21st century, American voters would be seriously considering as presidential candidates a neofascist and a neosocialist -- throwbacks to the old, failed utopias? Talk about fashionably retro!

Looking at Donald Trump stoking his supporters into a frenzy, attacking "them" -- whoever "they" happen to be at the moment -- vowing to return American to greatness and then flashing his self-satisfied smile, the mind harks back to those grainy newsreel images of Benito Mussolini , the theatrical Italian "Duce," the leader, who became the central figure of fascist Italy a century ago.

Is Trump a fascist? No, not quite. In fact, Trump doesn't propose anything close to a coherent ideology. He's a Trumpist. And we're only learning what that means, along with him, as he makes it up.

Fascists viewed the nation as an organism superseding the needs of the individual. That does not match Trump's rhetoric. But fascists also ridiculed and suppressed the opposition, and they embraced a level of authoritarianism that we can only hope Trump would reject. But who knows?

Cult of personality

One distinct similarity between Trump and the populist politicians of the 1930s is his ability to create and draw power from a cult of personality. The Republican front-runner's main campaign platform is that he will make everything OK. Trump will fix it. Trump will make America great again. How? That's not clear. He will do it by the power of his Trumpness. And we know it will work because look at him; look at how successful he is. Look how strong and fearless he is. There's very little in the way of substance. There's just a lot of Trump.

And to prove how much America needs him, he reminds voters that America is in deep, deep trouble. He hints at nefarious conspiracies; he highlights every problem and every threat, making it sound as ominous as possible. And then he vows to tackle it without mercy, even if it means committing war crimes, violating the Constitution , and expelling millions of people from the country. That, incidentally, would create the digital color version of those 1930s deportations : armed U.S. security forces (very armed) leading frightened people to the trains. (Or would he make them walk across the border?)

Charisma is a dangerous power in the wrong hands. When combined with popular discontent and disorienting change it can make a travesty of democracy and it can disfigure a society.

Validating prejudices

Trump has an uncanny ability to bring out the worst instincts in people. He validates the prejudices that people try to erase from their hearts. Trump seems alarmingly reluctant to distance himself from support from the KKK. Instead of debating ideas and policies, Trump insults and mocks people. He routinely appears to advocate violence against protesters, another disturbing throwback to the 1930s, and he draws a sharp distinction between "us" and "them."

We don't know what kind of a president he would be. It's hard to imagine he would continue to speak of punching people in the face, or that he would continue to mock people with disabilities, or follow through with any of his illegal or nonsensical proposals as a head of state. But there's no telling. He has already defied all predictions.

In a new turn of events since Thursday's GOP debate, Trump's opponents, who had seemed intimidated by Trump's savaging of Jeb Bush, have finally decided to take him on. It's good to see them challenging his empty offerings, but it's unsettling to see Sen. Marco Rubio also resorting to personality-driven attacks, eliciting uproarious laughter from his supporters. Despite the laughs, it's a sad sight.

Sanders found a scapegoat

Then there's the other end of the political spectrum: Sen. Bernie Sanders, the longtime Independent socialist politician now running as a Democrat.

Sanders is no 1930s Marxist. He is not advocating the takeover by the state of the means of production and the abolition of private property. But in the spirit of his socialist convictions, he too has found a scapegoat for all that ails America. Sanders would squeeze the rich, for whom he does not hide his contempt. In the manner of a demagogue, he declared , "Fraud is the business model of Wall Street."

Sanders proposes social programs containing the seed of potentially useful ideas, and he undoubtedly points to very real flaws in the system. But his overall approach, if it could ever be implemented, has the makings of an economic disaster . We know that because it was already tried.

Hillary Clinton's overwhelming victory in South Carolina may mark the beginning of the end for the Sanders movement, perhaps a sign that voters know Sanders' idealistic offerings, no matter how appealing, are disconnected from what is possible.

His plans would create deficits so large that there are not enough zeroes in calculator displays to hold them. His plans would produce deficits of between $18 trillion to $30 trillion (with a T) from new spending. You can squeeze the Wall Street billionaires as hard as you want. Even they don't have that much money. And while you're at it, see what happens to the economy if you impose the taxes required to even start those programs.

Sanders running honorable but mistaken campaign

Both Trump and Sanders are advocating granting much greater powers to the government. To be sure, Sanders appears to be aiming to force discussion of important issues in the campaign, and, unlike Trump, has run an honorable, throughtful and respectful campaign.

Trump would apparently expand government to secure the country from enemies and from immigrants. Sanders would do it to pay for social plans. Both positions carry a faint whiff of Nirvana, telling voters who feel unsettled -- by growing inequality, expensive unwon wars, and a sense that America is starting to fall behind -- that they have an answer to repair the country, to make them feel safe.

Again, this is not Europe in the 1930s, but the European experience carries a warning: Beware of politicians offering easy fixes. Rousing speeches are no guarantee of a better future. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
J.J. McCullough is an editorial cartoonist and writer. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

(CNN) Thursday is National Granola Bar Day (and National Hug Day). Saturday is even better: National Pie Day. And next Friday it's National Puzzle Day.

I don't know about you, but it seems like in the last couple of years we've been getting more and more "holidays" that we've never heard of. To name just a few: Raccoon Appreciation Day, National Oreo Cookie Day, Ninja Day and National Hat Day. At least on International Coffee Day , designated September 29, the flurry of social media zingers included free coffee at places such as Dunkin' Donuts and Krispy Kreme.

You might be tempted to think there's way too many phony-baloney faux holidays cooked up by people with way too much time on their hands. But, frankly, I think we need a lot more. Here are my nominees.

Marc J. Randazza is a Las Vegas-based First Amendment attorney and managing partner of the Randazza Legal Group. Follow him on Twitter: @marcorandazza. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.

(CNN) Donald Trump has said a lot of strange things -- some funny, some creepy, but none scarier than what he said on Friday : that if he is elected president, he will "open up our libel laws" to make it easier to sue the media and "win lots of money." No matter what you may think about his other policy ideas, if he keeps this promise, we won't be able to effectively express dissent against anything else he might want to do. We can fight any bad policy if we have a robust First Amendment.

Some say that Trump is just being a blowhard, that he doesn't know what he is talking about, and that for all his bluster, there is nothing he could or would do.

I am not so sure. Trump has a history of filing SLAPP suits. SLAPP stands for Strategic Lawsuit Against Public Participation. This describes a lawsuit filed against someone for exercising his or her First Amendment rights -- filed with little chance of success, but with the knowledge that the lawsuit itself is the punishment. After all, if people have to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to defend themselves because they criticized Donald Trump, they might think better of doing so again in the future.

However, some states, like California and Nevada , have strong anti-SLAPP laws, which dispense with such cases early and force the plaintiff to pay the defendant's attorneys' fees. (Full disclosure: I was instrumental in urging passage of the Nevada Anti-SLAPP law.)

Trump recently got stung with an anti-SLAPP decision, which he probably had in mind when he spoke about "opening up" our libel laws. In fact, he isn't the first big shot to try to make it easier to sue for defamation after having a SLAPP suit blow up in his face.

Therefore, Trump is clearly frustrated with anti-SLAPP laws (which shows that they work) and the landmark defamation case, New York Times v. Sullivan.

When people say that Trump can't do anything about defamation law at the federal level, I think they miss the point that there is a lot of support for a federal anti-SLAPP law. I think we need one, and in fact, HR 2304 was one such proposal this last session. If it passes, we could expect President Trump to veto it.

Beyond new federal legislation, defamation law is a matter of state law, leaving little for a president to do about it. To win a defamation case, the plaintiff must show publication of a false statement of fact that damages the plaintiff's reputation. This standard can vary a bit from state to state, but it generally fits that general set of requirements.

Therefore, what could Trump do to "open up" the libel laws? He personally? Nothing legally, but if elected, he could pick Supreme Court justices willing to revisit New York Times v. Sullivan, which is in my view the most important case protecting our First Amendment rights. It is the greatest protection we have from government officials or powerful businesses choking the life out of public debate and a free press. Overturning it would change everything we know about freedom of the press.

In a defamation case involving an ordinary citizen suing for defamation, the citizen only needs to show that the defendant knew the statement was false, or failed to exercise "reasonable care" before publishing it. So let's say that a blogger writes an article about a private citizen accusing that person of a crime, based on a false statement by a witness, without following up. That might be a failure to exercise reasonable care, and the blogger might lose the case.

But if the same blogger wrote one about a public figure, like Trump, then Trump has to prove that the blogger did so with "actual malice."

Even some judges and lawyers get this wrong, so don't feel bad if you didn't know what "actual malice" means. It has nothing to do with "malice" at all. It means that the defendant published the statement knowing it was false or with a reckless disregard for the truth.

So if we return to my example, let's say someone wrote a blog post about Donald Trump, accusing him of a crime, but based it just on an anonymous email, without following up -- that might be considered to be "reckless disregard."

Why the different standard depending on the plaintiff?

From New York Times v. Sullivan: "(W)e consider this case against the background of a profound national commitment to the principle that debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open, and that it may well include vehement, caustic, and sometimes unpleasantly sharp attacks on government and public officials."

Debate on public issues should be uninhibited, robust, and wide-open... Justice William Brennan

How beautiful that language is. It encapsulates what America is all about, the way only Justice William Brennan could.

The court recognized that public figures have access to the media to defend themselves, and it went on to reject any notion that the speaker must prove truth; instead the plaintiff must prove falsity. This is all because the First Amendment needs "breathing space" in order for free speech to survive. And if we impose liability for merely erroneous reports on political conduct, it would reflect the "obsolete doctrine that the governed must not criticize their governors."

So what if Trump appoints one or two Supreme Court judges who are willing to overturn Sullivan? Justice Elena Kagan has already voiced skepticism about the extension of Sullivan too far into other kinds of libel cases. The only member of the court I think we could count on to be strongly opposed to overturning it is Chief Justice John Roberts.

No matter how flawed it is, our democracy depends upon robust free speech and free press rights. New York Times v. Sullivan matters more than anything else.

Jeff Yang: Generation X is bitter

I belong to generation X, which might as well be called the interstitial generation. We're the cohort everyone skips over — the all-but-invisible slice of 50 million fortysomethings, jammed in between the self-satisfied boomers and self-indulgent millennials.

Yet, despite our generation's small size and overlooked status, we've nevertheless been handed the job of being America's cultural roadies, stuck with the grotty work of cleaning up a world-stage festooned with the detritus of decades of boomer indulgence, while simultaneously setting it for the triumphant arrival of the millennial headliners to come. (Plus we're raising the post-millennials to not be like their unappreciative grandparents and big siblings.) We gave the world the smartphone, the Internet and the social media revolution. In return, the world called us slackers. Is there any wonder we're bitter?

Paul Begala: Boomers, worst generation ever

Sixteen years ago I wrote in Esquire , "The baby boomers are the most self-centered, self-seeking, self-interested, self-absorbed, self-indulgent, self-aggrandizing generation in American history."

Nearly a generation later, I stand by every word. In fact, I'd like to double down on it. Boomers: Worst. Generation. Ever

Paul Begala, White House aide to President Bill Clinton, in front of Air Force One in 1993 during a campaign trip for the president's economic package.

In the intervening years, George W. Boomer ran up trillions in debt. He and fellow boomer Dick Cheney sent hundreds of thousands of younger, better men and women into combat (a chore each declined to do in their youth). The bill for their misdeeds -- in blood and treasure -- has been handed off to generations X, Y, Z, etc. (To be fair to the boomers, the other boomer-in-chief, my old boss Bill Clinton, embraced the best legacy of his generation, civil rights, women's rights, gay rights, while returning America to greatest generation-era economics: a budget surplus and a jobs boom.)

I'm at the tail end of the boom. Like President Obama, I was born in 1961. But the main boomer tsunami is hitting the shores of old age, the time in life when folks are most needy. They will need Medicare, Social Security, Medicaid, Meals-on-Wheels, nursing care and more. But they need not worry. Their children and grandchildren are more selfless, more service-oriented and far more committed to the common good. The irony is that while the greatest generation spawned the worst, it looks like the worst generation has given us another greatest generation.

Dasha Burns: Millennials have an existential crisis

Don't hate us -- we're just confused. We've seemingly made " changing the world " with our sparkling idealism, creativity and massive egos trendier than ever. And our generation really is changing the world -- we're upsetting traditional models in just about every sector from hospitality (Airbnb) to transportation (Uber) to advertising (the last time I watched a commercial was Super Bowl 2015).

Dasha Burns at a rooftop in Brooklyn.

But in dismantling old models, we're also making the world more bewildering for ourselves. It's harder to find applicable career advice from the older and wiser generations because what worked ten or twenty years ago won't necessarily work today. The job market is increasingly competitive and our career paths are increasingly less clear.

This is why many millennials I know are in a perpetual cycle of existential crises. We have to make money, change the world, all while showing off our zen skills at company yoga retreats.

Of course, these are the stereotypical millennials that everyone loves to hate. In reality, our generation is very diverse. But for many of us, the challenges brought by overturning traditions are very real, as comforts like the stability of working your way up in one company (or even one industry) for decades becomes a relic of days past.

We're faced with shining examples of 20-something CEOs urging us to stick it to the man and break out on our own. While generations past could decide on jobs based on a decent income and hours, we feel like whatever decisions we make may be upended in a couple of years.

So, take some pity on us when you're judging. And take comfort in the fact that we really do want to be productive members of society. In a lot of cases, it's that desire in overdrive that makes us move back home with our parents while deciding on the next move, or quit a job after three months because it just doesn't sit right.

We're the existential crisis generation because we want so badly to have purpose that we can get lost in the frenzy of looking for it.

Dasha Burns is a writer and works as a strategist and creative content producer at Oliver Global, a consulting agency where she focuses on leveraging media and digital technology for global development.

Pepper Schwartz: Call me lucky, at tail end of greatest generation

For me, it's a tale of two cities.

One city is heterosexual, born between 1945 and 1964 and positioned for greatness and opportunities. This is my city and most of us got inexpensive educations, good jobs out of high school or college, reasonable housing costs and women's liberation.

Pepper Schwartz with her best friend and writing partner, Philip Blumstein, in 1983.

Most of us had the sexual revolution without lethal sexually transmitted diseases. We were vocal and protested the Vietnam War, homophobia, gender inequity and racism. We saw women and minorities gain civil rights -- we feel somewhat smug that we helped them become CEOs, senators and president.

But there is the other city. The one that saw a whole generation of promising young men annihilated. These were the plague years of HIV/AIDS in the 1980s and 1990s, before there was a "cocktail," general sympathy, organized and effective movements for awareness. Those years were beyond awful: I lost my best friend and writing partner, Philip Blumstein, and then within eight months his life partner, Gary Jordan, unofficial godparent to my son. Every day brought a new victim. So many fallen souls, so much talent cut short.

Our generation was mixed. But I've been personally blessed. I had freedom in my twenties, marriage and children in my thirties, and a lifelong career that was unattainable for most women before my time. I just wish the cost of sexual and personal freedom for gay men had not been so high.

John Sutter: Hmm, identity crisis...

At 33, I'm a young-ish-but-sorta-old person with a generational identify crisis. I've been told I don't text back fast enough to be a millennial -- but I also don't have Kurt Cobain's death circled (in black) on my calendar, so maybe I'm not so gen X. I can quote "Reality Bites," a staple of the 30s to 40s set, but I also use Snapchat.

I'm both and neither. Generation-adjacent. Floating in time.

John Sutter's selfie at the Golden Gate Bridge in 2013, after he finished a reporting trip down the San Joaquin River in California.

I think people in my situation -- the youngish-sorta-getting-older set -- define ourselves mostly in terms of what we're not. Which is to say that we're not boomers -- or anything the boomers say about us. They're so en-TITLED, so NEEDY, so stuck in their little gadgets or whatever. You've heard that junk for years. It's almost trite to repeat. But since boomers run the media and the job market, there seems to be no shortage of "trend piece" drivel about the vapid millennials and our shoddy work ethic. If the boomers took 10 minutes to listen, they'd notice that young people today have it worse. The job market's better but still rough; part-timing's the norm. This is the age of inequality, climate change and anti-immigrant sentiment. We millennial-adjacents may seem wayward and indecisive -- but we're light years ahead on all those issues.

It's the boomers holding us back. I mean -- it is, right?

Donna Brazile: We got Steve Jobs and Oprah Winfrey

I'm a proud baby boomer. That's my generation, marked by the proliferating of our parents or grandparents after they returned from World War II.

Donna Brazile at the 20th anniversary of the March on Washington in 1983, which she helped organize.

From the beginning of the 1900s to about the mid-'60s, generations had romantic names: the lost generation, the greatest generation, the silent generation, the baby boomers. Then someone hiccuped and historians went generic: gen X, gen Y and gen Z.

If I were a member of generations X, Y or Z, I'd be miffed. Candidly, it's a wonder they don't suffer from an identity crisis. On top of bearing names as sterile as a supercomputer lab, they have to hear how they're all "me, me, me," and (further) will be the first generations to do worse in America than their parents. All I can say is that I will take the blame for the world that generations X through Z inherited from us. But, please do remember, we have not only lived through the traumas of our times, but yours as well.

For all our faults, any generation that produced Dolly Parton, Elvis, Elton John, Oprah Winfrey, Michael Jackson and Bruce Springsteen -- not to mention Steve Jobs and Bill Gates — has to be considered the best. But I am sure some of my friends in the millennial generation would likely say the best is yet to come. Go ahead. Prove me wrong.

Paul Callan: Gen Ys and millennials, stop whining

We baby boomers grew up watching small black and white TVs that carried only four networks that went off the air at midnight. Cable news and the Internet didn't exist. Most music came from static ridden AM radios.

In school sports, not everybody made the team. Parents didn't "helicopter" their kids. College students traveled between home and school by hitchhiking to save money. We didn't believe in haircuts or the Vietnam War. Everyone was afraid the Russians were going to nuke us. People under 25 feared getting drafted into the military if they didn't volunteer. A lot of my friends did and many got killed.

Paul Callan, from his Boston College Law School ID in 1975, when he was 25 years old.

In 1975, the starting salary for district attorneys in New York was $11,500 per year. When I began my legal career at the Brooklyn DA's Office, I didn't get a paycheck for six months because of New York City's financial crisis. The crime rate was three times higher than it is now and was handled by one-third the number of assistant district attorneys. We often worked nights and weekends for no extra pay. Didn't matter since we weren't getting paid anyway.

At work, there were "typewriters," "carbon paper" for making copies and "white out" to correct errors. Spellcheck had not been invented. You had to get it right the first time or you would look like an idiot to the judge because of all the white out on your document. Public telephone calls were made from "phone booths": the place where Clark Kent changes into his Superman costume.

Cigarette smoke hung in the air everywhere as smoking was permitted in offices, bars, restaurants, buses, movie theaters, airplanes and even in courtrooms and hospitals.

People who owned cars put "No Radio" signs on them because thieves smashed car windows and stole radios all the time. Replacing the glass was more expensive than the radio.

In 1977, New York's power system failed for over 24 hours and the city descended into a night of terror and looting. A serial killer called "Son of Sam" was still on the loose that night. But we survived.

We boomers are tough, resilient, hardworking and creative. Instead of whining, we invented rock 'n' roll.

Matthew Segal: What's holding us back?

Debating which generation is better or cooler is a popular but futile exercise. It's pretty clear, for instance, that every generation wishes it could claim Bob Dylan. Boomers win on that one. Debating which generation had it tougher, however, depends.

Matthew Segal providing testimony before the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Education and Labor in 2009.

To a certain extent, there have always been throngs of poor youngsters who work for minimum wage, toil as unpaid interns, or slog through as chronically underemployed baristas. What's alarming these days is the acute degree of income inequality Americans face: the highest since 1928. The house you are born into is much more likely to dictate your socioeconomic status than just about anything else.

The cost of college also matters -- a lot. Since 1978, university tuition has ballooned over 1000%. The notion of higher education has shifted. Ben Franklin, for example, saw it as a public good. Now it's seen more as a private commodity, financed largely through student loans. These loans are holding America back: A $1.3 trillion student loan debt crisis means houses, cars and goods are less affordable for young Americans, and that in turn drags down our entire economy.

Maybe we should compare ourselves to other countries where college is virtually free, or our friendly neighbors up north where upward mobility is on the rise, rather than previous or future generations in America.

Sarah Burris: Well, we all dislike Congress

The real reality that bites is that every generation was screwed by the economic dip, but every generation has an opportunity to try to fix it.

Millennials are lucky in that we have nothing like the Great Depression or the World Wars.

Sarah Burris, third from left, in Chinatown with her friends.

We are the most diverse generation in American history. We are also incredibly progressive.

We are creative and have used our ideas to make new things. Boomers invented the Internet, generation X improved it, and millennials found how to bring people closer through it. Even though we join all other generations in hating the nonsense that is the U.S. Congress, we remain optimistic that government can be used as a tool to help people, or, if you're a "Daily Show" fan, something to laugh at.

Like those who came before us we're neither better nor worse, good nor bad. We're different, and we bring different experiences and understanding to the table. There's no competition. We're in the same boat trying to do what we can with what we've got to make a better world.

Ana Navarro: For God's sake, just be thankful

I started by calling the Census Bureau. A representative called me back, without much information. “We do not define the different generations,” she told me. “The only generation we do define is Baby Boomers, and that year bracket is from 1946 to 1964.”

Next, I spoke with Tom DiPrete, a sociology professor at Columbia University. And he agreed with the Census Bureau. “I think the boundaries end up getting drawn to some extent by the media,” DiPrete said, “and the extent to which people accept them or not varies by the generation.” DiPrete explained that there was a good sociological reason for identifying the Baby Boom as a discrete generation. It “had specific characteristics,” and occurred within an observable time frame. World War II ended. You had the postwar rise in standard of living and the rise of the nuclear family. Then societal changes disrupted those patterns, and the generation, for academic purposes, was over. His main point: “History isn’t always so punctuated.”

I understood why Generation X, a generation defined by turmoil and uncertainty, would be poorly defined. But what about Millennials? Doesn’t their shared experience of the millennium transition and technology provide similar markers? “I actually haven’t seen efforts to document [generations] rigorously, and I would be somewhat skeptical that they can be documented rigorously,” DiPrete said. The things that have shaped Millennials—the rise of technology and social networks, for example—“affect people’s lives differently.”

“The media in particular wants definitions, identities,” DiPrete said. “I don’t know that the definitions are as strong or as widely shared across all the boundaries … At the end, I think it gets fuzzy.”

Well, yeah. We do want definitions. And if the media draws the boundaries, then allow us to do so definitively.

Your official demarcation of generational boundaries

We identified six different generations and labeled their eras.

Greatest Generation. These are the people who fought and died in World War II for our freedom, which we appreciate. But it’s a little over-the-top as far as names go, isn’t it? Tom Brokaw made the name up and of course everyone loved it. What, you’re going to argue with your grandfather that he isn’t in the greatest generation? The generation ended when the war ended.

Baby Boomers. This is the agreed-upon generation that falls within DiPrete’s punctuated time frame. It began when the Greatest Generation got home and started having sex with everyone; it ended when having sex with everyone was made easier with the pill.

Generation X. George Masnick, of the Harvard Joint Center for Housing Studies, puts this generation in the time frame of 1965 to 1984, in part because it’s a neat 20-year period. He also calls it the “baby bust,” mocking “pundits on Madison Avenue and in the media” who call it Generation X. Ha ha, tough luck. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Generation X has a gripe with pulse takers, zeitgeist keepers and population counters. We keep squeezing them out of the frame.

This overlooked generation currently ranges in age from 34 to 49, which may be one reason they’re so often missing from stories about demographic, social and political change. They’re smack in the middle innings of life, which tend to be short on drama and scant of theme.

But there are other explanations that have nothing to do with their stage of the life cycle.

Gen Xers are bookended by two much larger generations – the Baby Boomers ahead and the Millennials behind – that are strikingly different from one another. And in most of the ways we take stock of generations – their racial and ethnic makeup; their political, social and religious values; their economic and educational circumstances; their technology usage – Gen Xers are a low-slung, straight-line bridge between two noisy behemoths.

The charts below tell the tale.

To be fair, there are a few metrics that don’t fit this straightforward pattern of generational evolution. For example, over the course of their voting lives, older Gen Xers have tended to be more Republican than both older Boomers and younger Millennials. Also, Xers are more pessimistic than both of those larger generations that they’ll have enough money for their retirement – though some of that negativity is doubtless tied to the economic stresses of middle age.

Gen Xers also stand out in another way. In 2010 when Pew Research asked adults of all ages if they thought their own generation was unique, about six-in-ten Boomers and Millennials said yes. But only about half of Gen Xers said the same. And even among those who did, there was very little consensus about why they are distinctive.

One reason Xers have trouble defining their own generational persona could be that they’ve rarely been doted on by the media. By contrast, Baby Boomers have been a source of media fascination from the get-go (witness their name). And Millennials, the “everybody-gets-a-trophy” generation, have been the subject of endless stories about their racial diversity, their political and social liberalism, their voracious technology use, and their grim economic circumstances.

Gen Xers have also gotten the short end of basic generational arithmetic. Due partly to their parents’ relatively low fertility rates, there are fewer of them (65 million) than Boomers (77 million) or Millennials (an estimated 83 million assuming a roughly 20-year age span and including those who have yet to reach adulthood).

But there’s another reason that Xers are a small generation: They’ve been deemed to span just 16 years, while most generations are credited with lasting for about 20 years. How come? No one really knows. Generational boundaries are fuzzy, arbitrary and culture-driven. Once fixed by the mysterious forces of the zeitgeist, they tend to firm up over time.

One final slight: Even their name is a retread. World War II photographer Robert Capa first coined the term Generation X in a photo essay about the young adults of the 1950s, but the label didn’t stick the first time around. It was revived thirty years later by Canadian author Douglas Coupland, whose coming of age novel, Generation X: Tales for an Accelerated Culture, was set in Southern California.

For Xers, there’s one silver lining in all this. From everything we know about them, they’re savvy, skeptical and self-reliant; they’re not into preening or pampering, and they just might not give much of a hoot what others think of them. Or whether others think of them at all.

Paul Taylor, executive vice president for special projects at the Pew Research Center, is the author of The Next America: Boomers, Millennials and the Looming Generational Showdown (Public Affairs, 2014). In other words, he’s part of the problem. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Baby Boomers: Five Reasons They Are Our Worst Generation

Ten thousand are retiring every day. Good riddance.

Get a compelling long read and must-have lifestyle tips in your inbox every Sunday morning — great with coffee!

Wow, so it looks like we have a budget deal in Washington. A debt ceiling and spending crisis has been averted. It’s good news. But let’s all calm down. It’s only temporary. The agreement does not address the long-term fiscal problems we have. Problems that were mostly created by none other than the “baby boomer” generation. Yeah, you know who you are.

You’re tanned and healthy and living way past average life expectancy. You’ve got a defined benefit pension plan from a large company or government that was created years ago when people didn’t understand how horribly these plans can go wrong and now can’t afford to meet its liabilities, but you don’t care as long as you get your check which you don’t really need anyway. And your social security check. And your Medicare reimbursement check. You once hated the government. You smoked pot and protested against Vietnam and President Nixon. That was a long, long time ago.

Life has been good for you. You’re a baby boomer. You were born between 1946 and the early 1960’s. You had Woodstock and the Stones in the ’60s, discos and coke in the ’70s, Wall Street in the ’80s, Bill Clinton in the ’90s and now you’re retiring to Arizona and Florida on the backs of your stressed-out kids whose own children stay at home with them into their 20s because they have no jobs. Tom Brokaw once wrote a book about the greatest generation, those brave people who survived the depression and fought in World War II. Unfortunately that great generation spawned a generation of narcissists: the baby boomers.

The boomers have created liabilities that will take generations to pay off. Our national debt is now at around $17 trillion, larger for the first time in recent history than the size of our entire economy. And it’s projected to continue to significantly grow over the next few decades unless something dramatic is done to reduce it. Boomers don’t like to talk about fiscal responsibility or living within their means. They like their credit cards and government secured mortgages on overvalued properties. They enjoy their malls and their cars and their houses and as long as someone’s willing to lend them the money to buy this stuff they don’t seem to care much about how it will be one day paid. They still represent an enormous voting block and have no intention to have this lifestyle threatened. This is the real reason Washington can’t create a long-term deficit reduction plan. The boomers love their safety nets.

These safety nets were created over the past few decades by boomers and for boomers, with little regard to the future. One of the major reasons our national debt is so high is because 40 percent of our government’s spending goes to some type of insurance: social insurance, retirement, health benefits, Medicare, Medicaid, etc. These systems are bankrupt. But they’re needed to pay for the boomers’ healthcare and pension plans. People that were born after 1965 are working hard to make sure that the boomer generation gets their retirement and disability paid for by the government. But it’s still not enough. So our government has to borrow and print money. And our debts balloon. Who will pay these debts? Ah, who cares says the boomers. Not my problem.

They are the source of one of the biggest problems with Obamacare. Whether you support the Affordable Care Act or not (and I think there are lots of great things about it), one undeniable fact is that the cost of this new system is being put squarely on the shoulders of the young. People in their 20s need less health care than the boomers in their 60s and 70s. This is not only because younger people today have healthier lifestyles but because many boomers spent most of their young lives smoking, drinking sugary sodas and engaging in risky, unprotected sex. There are 34 million mostly young and uninsured people who will be required on January 1, 2014, to pay for health insurance just so the boomers can take advantage of the added benefits that health insurance companies have to now legally provide.

They are, thank God, the last reminders of our racist, homophobic, sexist past. When you look at those “white only” diners and drinking fountains in those photos from the 1960s you just can’t believe it. Or how women were treated. And gays. But many of our beloved boomers were teenagers back then, living with parents who watched Ozzie and Harriet and were raised to believe that people who weren’t white weren’t to be trusted, women were meant to stay at home, and gays were sinners. Over time, these attitudes have changed, mainly because people in their 20s and 30s are smarter, better educated and more open-minded. Unfortunately, and although we now have a black President, the last remnants of the boomer generation who still wield power in their churches and companies are doing their best to keep women out of the corporate suite, protest against gay marriage and fight immigration reform.

We’re scrambling to fix the environment because of their excesses. For years, and despite warnings, the boomers refused to recycle and ran companies that spewed ozone-destroying chemicals into the air. There are countless plots of land that are unusable because of chemicals and pesticides dumped by this generation. I’m no environmentalist, but even I have to shake my head at the destruction laid upon the planet over the past 40 years alone: decimated forests, extinct species, smog filled skies, islands of plastic floating in the ocean. Only recently are steps being taken by younger generations to attempt to reverse this trend.

The good news is that the baby boomer generation is quickly getting older. Ten thousand boomers are retiring each day. We can’t ship them all off to an island, unfortunately. But I’m optimistic that the next generation of leaders will not make the same mistakes. Governments will take care of people who are truly needy — not just because they turned 65 and have a car payment — and this will help fix our deficit problems. Racism will continue to decline as the world becomes smaller and more social. Our environment will improve because kids in elementary school are being taught to care about the planet. Ultimately, these generations will fix the problems that the boomers created. And we can soon bid farewell to that horrible generation.

The former president on climate change, curiosity, and what it means to be a leader

The office where I met Clinton high in the UN headquarters building belongs to another era. It is an institution built for a world of the past -- one based on Cold War rivalries and the last century's balance of power. It was Clinton's first day in the cramped space, and his entourage of bodyguards and assistants were stumbling over one another in the confines. The Secret Service men dispatched a young press aide to inquire why so many UN staffers were loitering near the elevators, though it was clear that they were simply trying to catch a glimpse of the ex-president.

"Is this the office?" an exhausted Clinton asked after shaking my hand. I nodded, as did most of the swarm that followed him. The entire place felt as if it hadn't been touched since the early fifties when the building was raised, a lone skyscraper above an otherwise flat block on the East Side of Manhattan. I heard him chuckle to a staffer as he stepped inside, "You know what," -- 'wahut,' the final word came out -- "It kinda reminds me of Mad Men. Have you seen that show yet?"







William Jefferson Blythe III never met his father, a traveling salesman who died in a car accident three months before Bill was born. He took the name Clinton from his hard-drinking and abusive stepfather, Roger, who Bill, at fourteen, demanded never hit his mother again. He hid the abuse from most people in his life. As a junior at Georgetown University, though, he shuttled back and forth to Durham, North Carolina on weekends to make peace with his dying stepfather as he underwent cancer treatments. Clinton almost never drinks; he sleeps little and speaks without reprieve. On the day that we met, the topics of his endless seminar ranged from the evolution of the light bulb to early twentieth-century American film to the beauty of Columbia's Aburrá Valley and Medellín.



Perhaps the most interesting dimension of his character is the pace with which he lives. "He had said to everybody over and over and over again," Chelsea Clinton has said, "that none of the men in his family live past sixty, or much past." As a result, he has always moved at a rather reckless pace, trying to accomplish as much as possible before a short clock -- either real, imagined, or prophetically self-fulfilling -- ticks to a stop.







As members of my generation look around the world today, we see climate change on the rise and nothing in the way of a successor for the Kyoto Protocol, the proliferation of nuclear weapons still un abated, Millennium Development Goals we're still well short of, a hugely imbalanced global economy that will continue to undermine itself, and I wonder if you worry that you and this post-Cold War generation of leaders will be judged harshly by history?



No. I think that's a cheap trick. I mean, all of this "the greatest generation is World War II?" -- it just happens that they're the most horrible parents in human history, right?



If all of us baby boomers were so bad, then our parents were terrible; they failed. And if we were so bad, how come our kids are so great? We were hellaciously good parents.



I think it's phony as a $3 bill. I think they had a chance to win World War II and it was clear. These are much more complex things [now]. We have no idea if the World War II generation would have made the decisions they should make on climate change if they thought doing so would bring an end to their economic prosperity.



The real problem in climate change is that we're paying for our past success. The established order has too many self-protecting economic entities, and not enough people who yet understand what it takes to change.



The World War II generation was thrown into a war by a madman, Hitler, and an expansionist empire in Japan, and we did what we had to do. Look, I admire the World War II generation; I'm just trying to make a point here. I don't think there are defective generations. There are times and struggles and they present different challenges.



I believe the United States will pass reasonably good climate change legislation, I believe we will get a successor that will be better than Kyoto, and I think that we're in a race against time and circumstance.



This will be calamitous if we don't do something about it, and the population of the earth will drop hugely over the next 1,000 years, maybe over the next 200 years, if we don't do something about it.



We're really in a race against time. I think history is a relay race and you just got to keep handing off and making things happen. I'm basically pretty optimistic.



Where the intersection of science and politics is on climate change, I'd leave to others. We might lose. Our minds may not be able to expand enough collectively to avert the worst.



I think most people are more literal and they learn things in a serial fashion. Most people have all they can do to keep body and soul together -- even before this economic collapse -- raise their kids, pay their taxes, worry about how to pay for college, deal with their mother's health, and everything.



It just takes time to change the mindset, but we're a much more communitarian country and a much more communitarian world than we were 20 years ago. I basically think you've got to get people's attitudes right, and then they have to have a general analysis that's right, and you have to organize for action. And you just have to stumble in the right direction. I'm pretty upbeat about it.



When you're my age, I hope you're dealing with a different set of problems. There'll always be problems, but that's what I hope will happen



David Leopolus, a childhood friend of yours, used to joke with friends that if they were bored, they could always go and watch you read. Is that insatiable curiosity critical to being a good leader?









I think in order to do one or two big things, you have to know many little things. I think it's also important in a complex time with a lot of dynamism to be able to relate to all different kinds of people, because, in the end, most political power depends more on persuasion rather than coercion.



And then I think you have to be able to reconcile the complexities and order them in a pattern. For a lot of people who just follow the evening news or read the morning paper, it's like the political equivalent of chaos theory in physics.



But your job, if you're a leader, is to take superficially random events and organize them into patterns that tell you what you should do to maximize an opportunity or head off the problem.



Being decisive in the face of complexity and ambiguity is important. Being able to make a call, to decide to act, and then figuring out how to act to support that decision. Yes, be curious; yes, appreciate the complexity and ambiguity; but then organize into patterns and decide what you're going to do and execute. I think that's extremely important.



You know, Machiavelli said in the 15th century that change was hard because the people who would benefit from it were uncertain of their gain and the people who would lose were positive of their loss; that's pretty much the way it still is. And if you sign on to be a progressive change agent, you had to have a high threshold for pain and you keep throwing yourself under the bridge, but I believe you can really make a difference if you just make these efforts and get up and work at it every day. I left the White House more optimistic than I entered it, after all I went through, and I would wake up every day believing that you can make good things happen.

In the 2008 presidential election, Clinton was cast as a villain, an overbearing spouse allegedly eliciting racism1 to propel his ambitious wife forward to the presidency and, conceivably, to reclaim a good deal of power himself. The Democratic presidential primary of 2008 muddled the esteem that had ballooned during eight years of gaffes and incompetence by his successor in the Oval Office. During that span, Clinton largely redefined the post- presidential years; he circled the globe as a nimble, intrepid freelancer, leveraging charisma and a seemingly limitless Rolodex for both the broader good and personal gain."Clinton is a nonprofit conglomerate," says one former advisor and long-time friend. It's not an in- accurate characterization. His work fittingly mirrors the rise of social networking and the Internet, a two-point-zero version of previous post-presidential benevolence.Among his most important accomplishments is his success drastically reducing the cost of life-saving anti-retro viral treatment for AIDS victims around the world. The latest round of deals with pharmaceutical companies -- on the heels of others that have helped two million people access treatment -- drops the cost of second-line regiments, for those whose illnesses have overcome first line drugs, by 60 percent. Commitments to charitable work made each year by individuals and corporations attending the Clinton Global Initiative conference reach into the billions of dollars. He launched a ten-year $100 million campaign against extreme poverty in Rwanda and Malawi and, in 2005, raised over a $120 million following Hurricane Katrina with George H. W. Bush.As president, his achievements were matched by equally notable shortfalls. He presided over a massive expansion of economic growth, generating surpluses of $122 billion and $230 billion during his last two years in office; he waged a successful campaign to stem genocide in Kosovo, and greatly expanded free trade and global commerce. But his failure to intervene in Rwanda, where some 800,000 were massacred, or to move effectively to stop genocide in Bosnia, or to advance middle east peace, marked high-profile failures. Domestically, he was unable to pass comprehensive health care reform and ambitious campaign finance reforms. He signed the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999, which had raised a wall between the speculative trading and underwriting of investment banks and the more traditional lending of commercial, depository banks. The law had been in place since the 1930s. Its elimination helped inflate the massive bubble that burst in the 2007 financial collapse, and meant commercial institutions, like Bank of America and Citibank, were allowed to assume massive risk in the form of housing market credit derivatives. They, of course, had to be bailed out to protect the broader economy. "I think they were wrong," he told ABC in April 2010, referring to his economics advisors, "and I think I was wrong to take [their advice]." The Monica Lewinsky scandal and a myriad of other sex-related allegations forever scarred his legacy and remains the first thought for many when his name is invoked.But for most of those who've had the chance to interact with Clinton, his warmth and intelligence overpower the more lurid details that special prosecutor Ken Starr seared into the American conscience. Clinton is surprisingly tender in person, a gentle handshake matches the soft white hair and the unmistakable bulb nose.He has been called the Michael Jordan of politics, an apt comparison in terms of both talent and intensity. Stan Greenberg, who worked as a consultant for both of Clinton's bids for the White House, recalled Clinton's rage at a Ross Perot attack in the closing days of the 1992 campaign: "They are attacking my character and we must attack Perot's character." He went on, speaking over the phone with aides after a long day of campaigning, "We need to take a meat axe to his brain, cut his head open." He demanded a response that was "red meat and passion, no more pussy ads." <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

Meanwhile, “Girls,” the HBO show about young people making their way in modern-day Brooklyn, has twice tackled the issue of grief and death this season, first when Hannah Horvath’s e-book editor, David, is found dead in the Hudson River. “Do you happen to know another publisher that I could maybe slip the manuscript to if I decide that I really want to try to keep it alive?” Ms. Horvath asks her editor’s widow at his funeral. (She promptly tells Hannah, using an expletive, to leave the reception; the protagonist seems to become more sensitive later in the season, when her grandmother dies.)

The show also highlighted how the Internet has made grief more public and casual, and therefore more fraught. “Why aren’t you mourning quietly?” asks Adam, Hannah’s boyfriend, after she reads him a part of her editor’s obituary on Gawker, which in real life has a tag called “And Now They’re Dead.” Twitter responses to death, like the hashtag RIP, which was widely used after the news of the fashion designer L’Wren Scott’s suicide, can also seem more like display than distress.

Ms. Birkner, a former obituary writer, said: “It’s not the nature of social media, generally, to react thoughtfully to things and think, ‘How can I really help?’ It would be great if everyone said, ‘Can I buy your groceries, or can I start a meal train?’ ”

Last February, on what would have been Ms. Rosenthal’s 28th birthday, Ms. Feldman found a long post on her dead friend’s Facebook wall from another friend speculating about how Ms. Rosenthal had died. “A lot of what she wrote wasn’t true,” Ms. Feldman said. “Becca’s mother was so upset, and I spent the whole day trying to do crisis management.” Ms. Feldman’s explanation for that kind of behavior is “performative grief,” she said, adding: “That’s the only excuse I can think of. The nature of the Internet allows for that sort of self-indulgent, ‘look at me’ behavior.” On the other hand, Ms. Birkner said she found support on Facebook on long-forgotten death anniversaries.

“It’s such a push-pull around the pros of allowing for a sense of community that the Internet builds and the distancing that it allows from having to personally interact with others, ” said Heather Servaty-Seib, a professor at Purdue in the field of thanatology, the study of death and dying, with an emphasis on adolescent grief.

Then there’s the lingua franca of social media — the like button — that’s totally discordant with death. “My God, is there anything creepier than a post announcing someone lost a loved one and seeing ‘136 people like this’ underneath?” Ms. Soffer said. Facebook floated the idea of a “sympathize button,” something that came out of its annual hackathon, but has no plans to pursue it, according to the company. (Facebook does offer an option to memorialize an account that prevents anyone from logging into it in the future, but allows friends and family, depending on privacy setting, to leave posts on the timeline.) <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
You're going to read this, and you're going to say, how is this about tech? I'm gonna head you off at that pass: This is a message from Internet, the generation that became the voice that set the tone for everything you love about the Net. And it's pissed. -Editor

Earlier generations have weathered recessions, of course; this stall we're in has the look of something nastier. Social Security and Medicare are going to be diminished, at best. Hours worked are up even as hiring staggers along: Blood from a stone looks to be the normal order of things "going forward," to borrow the business-speak. Economists are warning that even when the economy recuperates, full employment will be lower and growth will be slower-a sad little rhyme that adds up to something decidedly ­unpoetic. A majority of Americans say, for the first time ever, that this generation will not be better off than its parents. —New York Magazine

Generation X is sick of your bullshit.

The first generation to do worse than its parents? Please. Been there. Generation X was told that so many times that it can't even read those words without hearing Winona Ryder's voice in its heads. Or maybe it's Ethan Hawke's. Possibly Bridget Fonda's. Generation X is getting older, and can't remember those movies so well anymore. In retrospect, maybe they weren't very good to begin with.

But Generation X is tired of your sense of entitlement. Generation X also graduated during a recession. It had even shittier jobs, and actually had to pay for its own music. (At least, when music mattered most to it.) Generation X is used to being fucked over. It lost its meager savings in the dot-com bust. Then came George Bush, and 9/11, and the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Generation X bore the brunt of all that. And then came the housing crisis.

Generation X wasn't surprised. Generation X kind of expected it.

Generation X is a journeyman. It didn't invent hip hop, or punk rock, or even electronica (it's pretty sure those dudes in Kraftwerk are boomers) but it perfected all of them, and made them its own. It didn't invent the Web, but it largely built the damn thing. Generation X gave you Google and Twitter and blogging; Run DMC and Radiohead and Nirvana and Notorious B.I.G. Not that it gets any credit.

But that's okay. Generation X is used to being ignored, stuffed between two much larger, much more vocal, demographics. But whatever! Generation X is self-sufficient. It was a latchkey child. Its parents were too busy fulfilling their own personal ambitions to notice any of its trophies-which were admittedly few and far between because they were only awarded for victories, not participation.

In fairness, Generation X could use a better spokesperson. Barack Obama is just a little too senior to count among its own, and it has debts older than Mark Zuckerberg. Generation X hasn't had a real voice since Kurt Cobain blew his brains out, Tupac was murdered, Jeff Mangum went crazy, David Foster Wallace hung himself, Jeff Buckley drowned, River Phoenix overdosed, Elliott Smith stabbed himself (twice) in the heart, Axl got fat.

Generation X is beyond all that bullshit now. It quit smoking and doing coke a long time ago. It has blood pressure issues and is heavier than it would like to be. It might still take some ecstasy, if it knew where to get some. But probably not. Generation X has to be up really early tomorrow morning.

Generation X is tired.

It's a parent now, and there's always so damn much to do. Generation X wishes it had better health insurance and a deeper savings account. It wonders where its 30s went. It wonders if it still has time to catch up.

Advertisement

Right now, Generation X just wants a beer and to be left alone. It just wants to sit here quietly and think for a minute. Can you just do that, okay? It knows that you are so very special and so very numerous, but can you just leave it alone? Just for a little bit? Just long enough to sneak one last fucking cigarette? No?

Whatever. It's cool.

Generation X is used to disappointments. Generation X knows you didn't even read the whole thing. It doesn't want or expect your reblogs; it picked the wrong platform.

Generation X should have posted this to LiveJournal.

Every generation finds, eventually, a mode of expression that suits it. Cavemen drew lines on their cave walls. Sixties kids marched. My generation, we Gchat, a million tiny windows blinking orange with hopes and dreams and YouTube links, with five-year plans and lunch plans. So as I began to search for a single phrase that could, preposterously, describe our entire cohort, post-crash, I did what I always do in moments of crisis. I Gchatted my 24-year-old sister Clare, who happens to be living back at home with our parents while she looks for a job:

(10:24 p.m.) CLARE: how about they just call us SAA

self-absorbed assholes

ME: booo

CLARE: we need a D

to make it really good

SAD—self-absorbed delusionals

ps

(10:26) can i send you a cover letter right quick?

ME: sure

(10:28) CLARE:

our generation is:

delayed

afraid

immature

(10:29) independent

fame and glory hungry

(ambitious?)

weirdly apathetic when it comes to things outside of the internet

(10:32) ME: delayed is not our fault

CLARE: ok, you know what i always think about when i think of our generation? i read the david brooks book, “the social animal” and while it was only mediocre, he had this one really great bit that really stuck with me—the Greek ideal of “thumos”, which is the lust not for money or success (in the conventional sense) but the lust for glory

we want glory through our ideas-we want to know we matter

(10:33) the cold truth is that not all of us are brilliant

we are not all big thinkers. Not everyone’s TED talks will change the world

some of us will just dissipate into the ether

(10:34) but it is the digital connectivity, that proximity to these people, that makes us think that perhaps we will succeed as well

(10:35) ok, i’m done

(10:36) no i’m not

here’s why the recession is so devastating to us

we grew up, all the way through college, with everything seeming so ripe and possible

(10:37) we had a PC education—people tried to hide from us as long as possible that not everyone is equal

we were told we all have a fair chance of making it

that’s just not so

and we’re starting to realize that

(10:39) are you even listening to me anymore?

(10:41) ME: hi sorry

(10:42) i was writing an email

i am filing your comments

in my file.

(10:43) i think

your cover letter is good!

CLARE: i thought it was ok

(10:47) but I am, to be honest, expecting a rejection.

I know this might read as very woe-is-us, but these are the facts: Nearly 14 percent of college graduates from the classes of 2006 through 2010 can’t find full-time work, and overall just 55.3 percent of people ages 16 to 29 have jobs. That’s the lowest percentage since World War II, as you might have heard an Occupy Wall Street protester point out. (Not coincidentally, one in five young adults now lives below the poverty line.) Almost a quarter more people ages 25 to 34—in other words, people who should be a few years into their independent lives—are living with their parents than at the beginning of the recession.

Being young is supposed to mean you have the luxury of time. But in hard times, a few fallow years can become a lifetime drag on what you earn, sort of the opposite of compound interest. Because the average person grabs 70 percent of their total pay bumps during their first ten years in the workforce, according to a paper from the National Bureau of Economic Research, having stagnant or nonexistent ­wages during that period means you hit that springboard at a crawl. Economist Lisa Kahn explained to The Atlantic in 2010 that those who graduate into a recession are still earning an average of 10 percent less nearly two decades into their careers. In hard, paycheck-shrinking numbers, the salary lost over that stretch totals around $100,000. That works out to $490 or so less a month, money that could go, say, toward repaying student loans, which for the class of 2009 average $24,000. Those student loans (the responsible borrowing option!) have reportedly passed credit cards as the nation’s largest source of debt. This is not just a rotten moment to be young. It’s a putrid, stinking, several-months-old-stringy-goat-meat moment to be young.

Earlier generations have weathered recessions, of course; this stall we’re in has the look of something nastier. Social Security and Medicare are going to be diminished, at best. Hours worked are up even as hiring staggers along: Blood from a stone looks to be the normal order of things “going forward,” to borrow the business-speak. Economists are warning that even when the economy recuperates, full employment will be lower and growth will be slower—a sad little rhyme that adds up to something decidedly ­unpoetic. A majority of Americans say, for the first time ever, that this generation will not be better off than its parents.

The young persons in these slides reflect an extremely random sample of twentysomethings affected by the economy, skewed heavily toward college attendees and acquaintances of New York staffers. All slogans are their own words, though we provided the tape.

And so we find ourselves living among the scattered ashes and spilled red wine and broken glass from a party we watched in our pajamas, peering down the stairs at the grown-ups. This is not a morning after we are prepared for, to judge by the composite sketch sociologists have drawn of us. (Generation-naming is an inexact science, but generally we’re talking here about the first half of the Millennials, the terrible New Agey label we were saddled with in the eighties.) Clare has us pegged pretty well: We are self-centered and convinced of our specialness and unaccustomed to being denied. “I am sad, jaded, disillusioned, frustrated, and worried,” said one girl I talked to who feels “stuck” in a finance job she took as a stepping-stone to more-fulfilling work she now cannot find. Ours isn’t a generation that will give you just one adjective to describe our hurt.

It might be hard, in fact, to create a generation more metaphysically ill-equipped to adjust to this new tough-shit world. Yet some of us, somehow, are dealing pretty well.

Our generation is the product of two long-term social experiments conducted by our parents. The first sought to create little hyperachievers encouraged to explore our interests and talents, so long as that could be spun for maximum effect on a college application. (I would like to take this forum to at last admit that my co-secretaryship of the math club had nothing to do with any passion for numbers and much to do with the extra-credit points.) In the second experiment, which was a reaction to their own distant moms and dads, our parents tried to see how much self-confidence they could pack into us, like so many overstuffed microfiber love seats, and accordingly we were awarded clip-art Certificates of Participation just for showing up.

The finite supply of actual brass rings meant that the first experiment would never pan out, but the second was a runaway success. Self-esteem among young people in America has been rising since the seventies, but it’s now so dramatically high that social scientists are considering whether they need to find a different measurement system—we’ve broken the scale. Since we are not in fact all perfect, this means that the endless praise we got growing up, win or lose, must have really sunk in. (Meanwhile, it’s this characteristic that our parents’ generation—which instilled it in us!—so delights in interpreting as “entitled.”)

I’ve got a working theory about what’s happening as our self-esteem surpluses collide with a contracting world. A big chunk of our generation, the part David Brooks a decade ago collectively labeled the Organization Kid, more or less happily embraced very hard work within the system. (Brooks was focused on elite students, but I think the term applies equally well to your typical first- and second-honor-roll strivers.) If you were an Organization Kid and have prospered despite the economy, landing one of those jobs that come with an embroidered gym bag, you’re obviously fine. The big change is that when you describe yourself as lucky—a word that comes up a lot with friends I know like this—you may actually mean it more than you would have before. (Before, it would have just been codespeak for “privileged.”) If, though, you set track records and made summa cum laude—if you earned praise not just for effort but real achievements—only to land back in the same bedroom where you drilled for the SATs, then you are unmoored. Your less-decorated peers, feeling the love regardless of results, came to believe they’ll always be appreciated. Whereas you have had your worldview kicked in.

You become a little like my friend Lael Goodman. “The worst thing is that I’ve always gotten self-worth from performance, especially good grades. But now that I can’t get a job, I feel worthless,” she says. Lael, who is 27, was the valedictorian of her high school and did very well in college too. Unable to find a position that paid a decent wage using her En­glish degree, she got a master’s at the University of Michigan in environmental studies. She does technically have a job, for now, filling in for a woman on maternity leave at a D.C. nonprofit, but it’s not one that prevents all her go-getting from seeming for naught. Lael feels like she’s stranded on the wrong rung. “All the articles in the newspaper say that investing in an IRA now means I’ll have hundreds of thousands of extra dollars down the road, so I should just scrimp and save,” she says. “But I can’t scrimp and save because I’m doing that just to afford housing and groceries. So I’m screwed now, unable to enjoy young adulthood in the way that I feel I was promised, and screwed for the future.”

Then there is my friend Sam (not his real name, because he felt that if I used his real name, he’d truly be unemployable). In high school, Sam was the sports captain who set all the curves in calculus. I used to call him up the night before physics tests to figure out what I should know. Sam went to the best college he got into, for which he took out $50,000 in loans. He signed up for some abstract-math courses, was cowed by classmates who worked theorems for kicks, and majored in poetry writing rather than fall short in the subject he’d built so much of his identity on. After graduating, he took a job as a woodworker’s apprentice, not the expected outcome for a grade-grubbing gunner, but also not all that unusual back in the days before every decision about which major to sign up for or job to take started to feel make-or-break. One thing about being the boomers’ heirs growing up in boom times was that it used to be okay to take a life-enriching sabbatical. There was no reason to think you wouldn’t eventually be able to get back on track.

Sam found out that woodworking turned out to be mostly vacuuming up wood chips, and so after a few months, he moved on to a series of other gigs, none of them exactly a career. When he finally got sick of bouncing around in his broken-down $200 car and living with his parents—who kept pressuring him to revisit his math-and-science aptitude—he got himself a $25,000 bank loan, which he used to cover expenses while enrolled in continuing-ed classes in engineering at one of the U.C. schools. He ran out of money pretty quickly. He then found a job working in urban education, but was laid off after a year and a half. “That was the point in my life where I was like, I need to get a career, I need to make that move,” he told me over the phone, in the mellowed-out East Bay patois that had crept into his voice since I last spoke with him. These days, he’s going to networking events and desperately applying for jobs in the tech world, hopeful that landing something very entry-level will put him back on a navigable route to success. He’s had creditors calling him at all hours. He is rather earnestly worried that he might end up on the street. His brothers are managing to stand on their own feet, and he can’t bear to move back home.

“I have a lot of regret about going to college,” Sam, the person in my high-school class who’d been most obsessed with getting into a good college, now says. “If I could go back again, I think I’d try … not going to college”—our generation’s ultimate blasphemy.

Sam blames himself for his predicament, not the economy, mostly. But other people in similar straits are coming to see their personal hardships as the product of broad inequalities. How many young people will put themselves into that category is a big test for Occupy Wall Street. One of its advocates created a Tumblr, “We Are the 99 Percent,” to collect accounts of being screwed by the recession. The posts from twentysomethings take stories that sound something like Lael’s—“I worked hard (40 hours a week during most of my education), for what? Tell me what I need to do to get ahead, because I did everything right!”—and make them a call to arms.

The unions, we know, are heeding that call, but a broader youth movement has yet to materialize.* The Obama 2008 campaign was the high-water mark for twentysomething political involvement. The activism it entailed felt like work—not a turnoff for us. Dialing your way through spreadsheets of get-out-the-vote phone numbers is something you can add to a résumé; getting escorted off the Brooklyn Bridge in those plastic handcuffs is not. But we’re done with that kind of engagement, for now: While this is by some measures the most politically progressive generation ever, young people have never been more disillusioned, as a group, about their ability to bring about meaningful change through the electoral process.

*This article has been updated from its original version. Yaphet Murphy is 38 years old, not 28, the age he had given to the author and a fact-checker. Because that puts him outside the focus of the essay, a paragraph describing his struggle to find work has been removed.

Sam Graham-Felsen was the Obama campaign’s chief blogger last cycle and now lectures about youth activism all over the world. When we spoke during the early days of the protests, he wasn’t convinced Occupy Wall Street could make activism cool for kids again, a factor he views as a key difference between the U.S. and ­places like Egypt. “Even just the physical style, the types of chants, the stuff that they’re eating, the granola—it’s just so derivative of the sixties,” he said. “It’s like, ‘Guys, let’s do something that’s more our generation.’ ”

What’s not clear is exactly what that might look like. It’s not that this is a generation that doesn’t want to improve the world—been to a college activity fair lately?—but ours is a fractured involvement. The Cold War sort of settled which was the superior economic and political system, leaving youthful calls for revolution to be shouted in the context of gay rights and women’s rights and pro-Palestinian-hummus-in-the-campus-cafeteria demonstrations, which are really about improvements to the status quo, not a wholesale overthrow. In the sixties, that generation’s protesters wanted a blank slate, economic and political chaos out of which they could build something new. We’ve got that chaos, and all we want is a way to get back to the structured prosperity that preceded their marching. It’s hard to build a potent counterculture when some of the people it’s meant to appeal to are just hoping for the chance to put on a tie and report to their cubes.

“Maybe I don’t have to make a splash. Maybe I’ll be okay with just keeping afloat.”

If you look at the people on the left who have painted the darkest picture of what the economic downturn means, they’re a generation ahead: Matt Taibbi, for one, or Ken Layne, the publisher of Wonkette, whose ironized blog prose mixes strangely with his incredibly bleak reading of the economy and culture. (Layne told me, in an e-mail of ambiguous sincerity, that the main advice he would give a recent graduate was to own only what would fit in a backpack and keep a current passport always on hand.) They are unabashedly, feverishly upset. Their words practically sweat clammily. Our generation tends to prefer our dystopian news ­delivered with the impish smile of a Jon Stewart. (I turn the channel when it’s time for scowling, ranting Lewis Black.) Reared to sponge up positive reinforcement that requires only a positive attitude as a buy-in, we are just not that into anger.

I spent the summer listening to Helplessness Blues, an album by Fleet Foxes. It is sweet and comforting and hated by a certain kind of music snob, and it was unexpectedly popular. The band, fronted by a 25-year-old, owes much to the sounds of groups like Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young, but if such a thing is possible, Fleet Foxes makes those older acts sound hard-edged. The folk music of the sixties was protest music, but there is nothing remotely political about this. Instead, the preoccupations are inward-turning, the title track serving as a gentle generational anthem: “I was raised up believing / I was somehow unique / Like a snowflake, distinct among snowflakes / Unique in each way you can see,” it begins. “But, now, after some thinking, I’d say I’d rather be / A functioning cog in some great machinery / Serving something beyond me.” It’s not just the bearded dudes in flannel; some of our angry-sounding musicians, it turns out, are just seeking affirmation. On the song “Radicals,” rapper Tyler, the Creator snarls, “I’m not saying just to go out and do some stupid shit, commit crimes. What I’m trying to tell you is, do what the fuck you want, stand for what the fuck you believe in and don’t let nobody tell you you can’t do what the fuck you want.” Then the kicker: “I’m a fucking unicorn, and fuck anybody who say I’m not.” Today’s fucking unicorn is yesterday’s “Fuck tha Police.”

Television writers, a lot of them young themselves, are starting to offer their own expressions of our generation’s shifting sensibility. Pre-crash, we had the creamy male fairy tale of Entourage. Now HBO serves up How to Make It in America, a slightly grittier prequel to the good life that implies simply being marginally in the mix of a certain kind of scene—it’s no longer necessary to have ascended to the top—constitutes “making it” today. And CBS is enjoying a hit with 2 Broke Girls, set in a diner in Williamsburg and co-created by Michael Patrick King, whose Sex and the City prerecession fantasia ran on a constant loop in college girls’ dorm rooms in the mid-aughts as we put on our heels and going-out tops and drank vodka from Solo cups. The show is neither very good nor very accurate in its portrayal of what it’s really like to be a broke girl living in Williamsburg (hi!), but it does get one big thing right. It centers on the sardonic heroine Max, played by Kat Dennings, who beneath her surface armor is hamstrung by faltering self-confidence after, we are meant to imagine, being unable to get anything better than her waitressing gig. Her co-worker foil, Caroline, the spoiled, newly destitute daughter of a Madoff-esque figure, refuses to wallow despite her fall from privilege, and dreams up a cupcakery as a way to split the difference between the waitressing grind and the life she had coming her way. Obviously, a vegan falafel truck would be a much more 2011-appropriate start-up scheme, but never mind: Their attempts to deal with adult disappointment, to find a new path, now make for a plot with a lot of mileage in it.

In the early days of the recession, I was secretly a little jealous of friends who’d lost their jobs. When you’re young enough, from the outside a layoff can look confusingly like liberation. It seemed like an opportunity to do more of the semi-sanctioned and semi-scripted fucking around that goes with this decade of life. But it stops feeling like a fun, sexy choice when it’s not, in fact, a choice, and what income you’re fortunate to have is highly nondisposable. It’s hard to fully enjoy avoiding maturity if you’re worried that it’s more like maturity is escaping you.

Amid all the jumping around between jobs and among beds, the twenties are, for a lot of people, the time to figure out whom you want to settle down with. The economy has pushed back that rite of passage: The median age of first marriages has crept up by about a year since 2006—a statistically huge increase—and the overall marriage rate is at an all-time low. The number of women between 20 and 34 rose by about a million between 2008 and 2010, but the number of children born to the group dropped by 200,000. Thirty-nine percent of us in a 2010 National Journal poll were getting financial help from relatives, including a full quarter of those with full-time jobs. Those statistics partly stem from actual hardship. But they also seem to reflect inflated expectations of the lifestyle you need to have attained before you’re ready to move on to your next stage.

And yet: Some of us are learning to make the trade-offs. For 27-year-old Lydia Greaves and her husband, the choice was the house they dreamed of buying in his native Seattle or the family they dreamed of simultaneously starting, but not both. He, a lawyer, couldn’t find work for nearly a year after getting his J.D., and she, an environmental chemist, was laid off for a while in 2010. They’ve decided to put off saving for the down payment and try for the kid first. “If we wait until we feel like we’re financially ready, I’d be 40,” she says. “It was like, ‘Okay! In that case …’ ”

It’s not exactly a happy story, but it can be a hopeful one. And the early-onset pragmatism is trickling down. One of the youngest young people I spoke with was Kristine Nwosu. The child of Nigerian immigrants, she’s 19 years old and a sophomore at Temple University, putting her among the first members of our generation to enter college knowing full well the scary merry-go-round they’ll be climbing aboard when they’re done. Her mother is a nurse and her father a chef who, even before he started cancer treatments and underwent a liver transplant this summer, had struggled financially, losing both a restaurant and a catering business. Kristine used to want to cook for a living, too. But she’s leaning toward studying to be a pharmacist, a field for which hiring prospects remain bright. “I have a slight interest in it,” she says. That now feels like enough.

Recently it has become important to me to buy lamps for my very small apartment. I have been in it more than a year, and it’s starting to feel claustrophobically tiny. I can’t make it any bigger, but I can make it brighter, and so I have spent hours browsing the web for shades with the right transparency, the ideal height. I move lamps around daily, trying to find the combination that will make cramped feel cozy, that will cast a golden glow if I stick them in the right corners.

It occurs to me that what I am trying to do with lamps—to make the best of limited circumstances, to brighten what feels shabby—is the domestic side of what I’ve already done with my professional self. I’m one of those young people always calling themselves lucky: I’ve been employed throughout the downturn, in the industry that I wanted to work in. But at my old job, there were several rounds of layoffs. The first robbed me of my cubicle mate, the last (which came after I’d left) hit veteran colleagues at the top of their games. Watching that, I decided to never count on career stability and have tried to be less defined by my work. Some of my friends have recalibrated as well. “I look at the people in positions of authority in my office and see the stress and pressure they are under,” says one. She has lowered the bar beyond which satisfaction supposedly waits. “It makes me think, Well, maybe I don’t have to be in charge. Maybe I’ll be okay with just keeping afloat rather than making a splash.”

It’s part of the American way to get a lot of self-worth from your job. Meanwhile, one of the reasons there aren’t enough of those jobs out there is that America no longer makes enough stuff. Young people feel that void, intrinsically. Making stuff is what got us smiles from our parents and top billing in refrigerator art galleries. And since we are, as a generation, more addicted to positive reinforcement than any before us, and because we have learned firsthand the futility of finding that affirmation through our employers, we have returned to our stuff-making ways, via pursuits easily mocked: the modern-day pickling, the obsessive Etsying, the flower-arranging classes, the knitting resurgence, the Kickstarter funds for art projects of no potential commercial value. The millions upon millions who upload footage of themselves singing or dancing or talking about the news to YouTube. Of course, funny videos and adorable hand-sewn ikat pillows aren’t the only kind of stuff that people are making as a way of coping with harsh economic realities—meth, for instance, comes to mind. But putting aside those darker enterprises, this is a golden age for creativity and knowledge for their own sakes. Our pastimes have become our expressions of mastery, a substitute for the all-consuming career.

Even status updates and photo albums on Facebook are part of this. Jonathan Franzen wrote a commencement speech–cum–jeremiad last spring against our generation for, as he sees it, substituting Facebook “liking” for real-life passion for something. But the thumbs-up isn’t a substitution for anything. It is just a tiny kindness, a sweet pat on the back, and the profligacy with which we give them out is just a function of a generation’s giving out compliments in the volume in which we received them growing up. Thumbs down, Franzen, for missing the point.

On the day before I turned 27, I went to meet my friend Desi for a beer and a burger. He is a thoughtful, very smart 24-year-old college dropout, smallish and dark-haired with a bushy Brooklyn beard. He rides a motorcycle and seems to be friends with half the staff of places like Four & Twenty Blackbirds, where his roommate works as a baker. He took time off from Georgetown on a lark to work on an offshore oil platform and get some life experience (“stories rather than ideas,” he said—admitting in the next breath that it may have had something to do with the number of times he’d read On the Road) and wound up never returning to school. When he dated my roommate a couple of years ago, he was paying the bills with a gig delivering cloth diapers, and she made it sound like he was having trouble finding other work. Desi is the guy you would have once said had thrown away his future but today seems like maybe he’s got something figured out.

The morning before we met, Desi’s motorcycle had broken down. If his truck goes next, he won’t have the money to fix it. “A little bit of bad luck, and things can unravel pretty quickly,” he said. But Desi wanted to sell me on the merits of constrained circumstances, not tick off tales of woe. He is still delivering diapers, but he’s now got another job as a woodworker-slash-lacquerer. He finds a satisfaction in the craft that eluded Sam, my high school’s former can’t-miss kid, during his woodworking interregnum. Desi does a great deal of yoga. He proselytizes about the book Shop Class As Soulcraft. “Getting better at enjoying life” is something he describes very seriously as a goal. This is not something that requires a big salary, and he doesn’t think his mind-set will change much with age. He has only so much sympathy for the complaints of his girlfriend, a 2011 college graduate working retail who is devastated that she’s been unable to find a job that requires a degree.

Remember how most Americans think this generation will be worse off than the one that preceded it? This generation doesn’t agree. A plurality of young people still think they’ll do better than their parents. Our optimism is surprisingly durable. A large-scale Pew study published in 2010 showed that about 90 percent of us either say that we currently have enough money or will eventually meet our long-term financial goals—we’re more hopeful on that front, in fact, than we were before the recession.

Clark University’s Jeffrey Arnett, who studies what he calls the life phase of “emerging adulthood,” points out that people who respond with optimism to questions like that don’t necessarily see “better off” as simply a question of wealth. For nonwhite Americans, certainly, there’s less discrimination than their parents faced, and that may affect responses. But there’s evidence to suggest other members of our cohort believe they’ll live a more fulfilled life, have better relationships, even if they don’t live in larger houses or drive fancier cars than their parents. Jean Twenge, author of Generation Me, says the most prominent shift she has seen so far among young people in this economy is an apparent decrease in materialism. We are less interested in stuff, but still very interested in self.

Desi’s onboard with less stuff. “You don’t need to have money to buy a huge record collection; you have Grooveshark. You don’t need that shit. Life is just getting easier.” And it definitely is, in terms of access to entertainment. Facebook and video games and Twitter and Internet memes and Google Books and smartphones and free apps have made life on a small budget a lot more diverting. Rob Weitzer, a 24-year-old ­Bushwick dweller who grew up in Connecticut and has been spottily employed since graduating from the New School, puts it this way: “My parents are well off financially, but I’m better off culturally.”

Desi’s father happens to be an engineer who worked for the company that made the StairMaster, that very boomer self-improvement device. His grandfather did important work on a generationally defining product of his own. Desi’s grandfather was John Rawls, the philosopher credited with expanding the intellectual framework for the modern social safety net. Desi also cares about safety nets, but smaller ones. “Feeling like you can take care of yourself and your friends … that’s the answer,” he told me when we were talking about Occupy Wall Street, and whether it’s worth it to be involved. “You know, you find a community where you don’t feel that powerlessness.” I bring up his grandfather’s legacy. He redirects the conversation. “Definitely, if you don’t do something, it’s not going to happen. But if you do do something, it’s still probably not going to happen. Your time could be time that you spend enriching your own life.”

Twenge, the Generation Me author, turned me on to the existence of a concept called “locus of control.” Essentially, it’s a measure of whether you think your destiny is controlled by you or outside forces. For years, young people have increasingly placed their loci of control outside themselves, and this is true of my generation more than any yet. It seems unlikely that a global financial crisis that revealed just how deeply ingrained, intertwined, and intractable are the world’s problems is doing much to counteract that trend. Yet someone like Desi manages to place the locus of control firmly within himself, centered narrowly on his own life and the people he knows. Notwithstanding what that attitude portends for social justice (nothing good), maybe it’s the only way to feel like you are in charge of your own destiny, by focusing your lens ever tighter.

Another phrase I now can’t get out of my head is “managed decline.” It’s been batted around in the context of Europe; George Soros splashily said it about the U.S. dollar a few years ago; and Ken Layne, the Wonkette Cassandra, used it when we spoke. It also strikes me as a fairly good way of describing the process of getting older. That’s what we’re doing when we decide that we can be okay with having more unpredictable careers and more modest lifestyles, if that’s what’s in store: Even as we hold out hope that something will reverse the trajectory, we are managing our decline, we are making do.

Desi and I tried to picture the country in 50 years, as a kind of parlor game. “Oh! Mushroom cloud! It’s going to be a disaster!” he said. “It’s so overwhelming there’s nothing in particular to be worried about.” We both laughed, because it’s true.

Sister Helen Prejean, a Sister of St. Joseph, ministers to prisoners on death row. She is the author of " Dead Man Walking ." The views expressed are her own.

(CNN) I'm praying for Justice Antonin Scalia, that his passage into eternity was peaceful. I respect his sincerity, even though on the subject of the death penalty, he was my nemesis.

As I was writing "The Death of Innocents," I happened to run into him in an airport, and I said teasingly that I was "taking him on" in my book. And he, personable as he was, jabbed his finger in the air and said, "And I'll be right back at ya!"

In "Innocents," I wrote about two men I believe were innocent: Joseph O'Dell and Dobie Gillis Williams , whose executions Scalia summarily authorized without an apparent qualm, acknowledging that his role on the Supreme Court made him part of the "machinery of death."

In grasping the "meaning" of state killings, I had one advantage over Scalia. I was there, close up to the anguish and terror of the condemned and their grieving mothers. Scalia, in the cerebral confines of the Court, never touched a tear-stained cheek, never stood present at the grave as families buried their loved ones killed by the state.

One thing the justice and I did have in common, however, was this: he stumped around the country to persuade citizens of the rightness of his "originalist" approach to the Constitution; I stumped around the country (still do) to persuade citizens to abolish the death penalty, laying out my arguments through stories of personal experience, beliefs of my Catholic faith and logical, fact-infused arguments, including Constitutional analysis.

After all, as citizens, are we not the ultimate proprietors of the Constitution and its meaning for our lives? Are not its protections of life and liberty far too precious to blindly be turned over to legal "experts," every bit as prone to prejudice and blind spots as the rest of us?

I have profoundly disagreed with Scalia on two fronts: jurisprudence and religious faith.

As for his jurisprudence, I do not think that the only correct way to interpret the Constitution is to interpret its words (text) as, supposedly, our 18th century framers understood them.

Given what we now know about the fluid nature of text and context in linguistics, that's an impossible task. Even more impossible is to confine ourselves to the practice of punishment as they practiced it, which, to most modern eyes, was harsh in the extreme.

In 1999, I accompanied Dobie Gillis Williams into the killing chamber of Louisiana three times before my native state finally killed him. An African American with a very low IQ, Dobie was sentenced by an all-white jury to die for supposedly killing a white woman.

I say supposedly because even though the appeals courts upheld Dobie's guilt, I am convinced of his innocence. I tell Dobie's story in"The Death of Innocents," taking readers through our broken system of justice that masks truth and gets poor men like Dobie executed.

Three years after Dobie's death came a Supreme Court decision that, had it come earlier, might well have saved his life, a decision in which Scalia fiercely dissented . In Atkins v Virginia (2002), the court ruled 6-3 that executing people with mental disabilities -- that is with an IQ of 70 and below -- violates the Eighth Amendment's ban on "cruel and unusual punishments."

In his dissent , Scalia used as his moral criterion an 18th century dictionary's definition of "idiot" as "such a person who cannot account or number twenty pence, nor can tell who was his father or mother, nor how old he is." According to Scalia's perception of the Constitution as not living but dead, that archaic definition should have guided the court's decision and not any modern understanding of diminished mental capacity. Dobie, who had an IQ of 65 but knew exactly who his mama was, would have failed Scalia's "idiot" test.

My second argument with Scalia was the way he interpreted Catholic teaching about the death penalty. Church opposition to government executions has developed considerably in recent years, which to Scalia was anathema. He interpreted his Catholic faith as he interpreted the Constitution, staking his position in unchangeable tradition, upheld by Saints Augustine in the 5th century and Thomas Aquinas in the 12th.

These stalwart teachers, he maintained -- unlike Catholic American bishops so easily swayed by "modern trends," as he saw it -- upheld the righteousness of government-imposed executions as God's will, justified in the same way as the killing of a rabid dog or the amputation of a gangrenous limb.

Thus, Scalia could not brook American bishops' increasing opposition to the death penalty, nor the opposition of Popes John Paul II and Francis -- especially Pope Francis, who must have disturbed the justice considerably in his bold appeal before Congress for global abolition of the death penalty.

-- "It seems to me that the more Christian a country is, the less likely it is to regard the death penalty as immoral. Abolition has taken its firmest hold in post-Christian Europe and has least support in the church-going United States."

-- He interpreted St. Paul's words, "The powers that be are ordained of God," to mean: "Government derives its moral authority from God. It is the minister of God with powers to revenge, to execute wrath, including wrath by the sword, which is unmistakably a reference to the death penalty. ...These passages from Romans represent the consensus of Western thought until quite recent times ... regarding the powers of the state. That consensus has been upset by the emergence of democracy."

Democracy, indeed. Do our elected leaders derive the authority to govern from the people or by direct divine infusion? That's theocracy, not democracy.

Where was Jesus in the Justice's stance of faith? Where is his moral challenge to rise above seeking "an eye for an eye," to pray for and forgive our enemies?

In Chicago, Scalia justified his interpretation of Scripture by making a distinction: individual Christians must follow Jesus' call to forgive, but not the state.

In this distorted reading, state governments as God's ministers have God's blessing to inflict wrath on evildoers and those they deem "enemy."

It seems Scalia was as adept at drawing bright lines in the practice of his faith as he was in his jurisprudence. Now the bright line of death has been drawn across his life. I pray that he finds eternal rest.

I also hope and pray that the ninth new justice will be a person, who not only has an excellent legal mind, but also a compassionate and fair-minded spirit, in close touch with the struggles and aspirations of ordinary people -- especially the most vulnerable among us for whom "equal justice under law" is a cruel chimera if not an outright lie. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

How are you? It must be so exhausting running for President. I hope you're taking good care of yourself.

I happened to be flipping through the channels on Thursday night when I saw you talking to Donald Trump at the Republican debate about what you called "New York values." I wasn't sure at first what you meant, but then you explained: "I think most people know exactly what New York values are: socially liberal, pro-gay marriage, pro-abortion, focused on money and the media."

For a moment I actually thought Mr. Trump was speechless, but duh, he's a New Yorker like me, and nobody cherishes the First Amendment more than us!

Anyway, it's a new day.

I bet you saw the building as your plane was landing; it's one of those huge towers downtown by ground zero. Maybe you didn't have enough time, since you never know how the traffic is going to be on the George Washington Bridge when you're driving in from the airport.

I live on the Upper West Side and my girlfriend and I are planning to get married as soon as we can find a big enough apartment to comfortably fit all four of us (two kids included). Both our apartments are rent stabilized, so we're taking our time finding the right place. If you're not familiar with the rent laws in New York, you should check them out.

n 1997 , our Republican mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, extended rent regulation laws after a big to-do with Republican State Sen. Joseph L. Bruno, who wanted them eliminated. Thank goodness, our mayor had two important allies: Republican State Sens. Roy Goodman of Manhattan and Frank Padavan of Queens, who both agreed with the Democratic-controlled State Assembly.

Have you ever been to Queens, Ted? It's the most racially diverse county in the contiguous United States . My favorite Greek restaurant is in Astoria. Do you like Greek food? It's yummy. Asghar, my driver, and I were talking about how many great places there are to eat here in NYC. He was born in Pakistan, and moved here as a baby. He married a woman from Colombia and their two kids are just beautiful, and get this -- they're also tri-lingual! They speak English, Urdu and Spanish. I must admit that I'm a little jealous about that.

John Kasich, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio, Donald Trump, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, Ben Carson and Jeb Bush. It is the sixth GOP debate of this election cycle and the first of 2016. Hide Caption 1 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Trump, who has been leading GOP polls for months, answers a question during the debate. "I'm very angry because our country is being run horribly, and I will gladly accept the mantle of anger," he said. Hide Caption 2 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Cruz speaks during the debate. The senator from Texas opened the event by talking about the U.S. sailors recently detained by Iran. "Today," he said, "many of us picked up our newspapers, and we were horrified to see the sight of 10 American sailors on their knees, with their hands on their heads. ... I give you my word, if I am elected president, no service man or service woman will be forced to be on their knees, and any nation that captures our fighting men will feel the full force and fury of the United States of America." Hide Caption 3 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Bush waves to the audience. The former Florida governor has been trying to build momentum that he had in the early stages of his candidacy, and he went after Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton early in the debate. "She's under investigation with the FBI right now," he said. "If she gets elected, her first 100 days, instead of setting an agenda, she might be going back and forth between the White House and the courthouse. We need to stop that." Hide Caption 4 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Rubio delivers an answer during the debate. He frequently attacked President Barack Obama. "When I become president of the United States, on my first day in office, we are going to repeal every single one of his unconstitutional executive orders," the senator from Florida said. "When I'm president of the United States, we are getting rid of Obamacare and we are rebuilding our military." Hide Caption 5 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Carson promised this week he would "insinuate" himself into the conversation when needed. After a discussion between Rubio and Christie during the debate, Carson told moderator Neil Cavuto, "Neil I was mentioned too." Cavuto asked, "You were?" Carson quipped, "Yeah, he said everybody." On a more serious note, Carson noted the "divisiveness and the hatred" in today's society. "We have a war on virtually everything -- race wars, gender wars, income wars, religious wars, age wars. Every war you can imagine, we have people at each other's throat," he said. "And our strength is actually in our unity." Hide Caption 6 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Kasich touted his economic record as governor of Ohio. "Our wages are growing faster than the national average," he said. "We're running surpluses. And we can take that message and that formula to Washington to lift every single American to a better life." Hide Caption 7 of 12 Photos: Republicans debate in North Charleston Christie, like most of the candidates on stage, continued to be tough on the current administration. "Tuesday night, I watched story time with Barack Obama," he said of the recent State of the Union address.

Hey, I heard that you are a huge fan of "The Princess Bride." Me, too!! Did you know that they are talking about bringing it to Broadway? That would be so amazing, because William Goldman wrote the book right here in NYC!

Have you seen any Broadway shows recently? I think you would just LOVE "Hamilton." Lin-Manuel Miranda wrote it and it's very historical. He's from Washington Heights and he's so talented. I'm warning you that it's hard to get tickets, but I'm sure you have some "in" somewhere. And check out "Kinky Boots" and "Fun Home" if you can. You won't be sorry!

I wish I had more time to write, but I have so much to do. I'm going to probably take a Citi Bike (a great way to get around Manhattan, btw), over to the Museum Of Modern Art to get a ticket to the Picasso exhibit.

And then I'm going to take the subway to my son's basketball game over at his public high school near Times Square. Have you ever taken the subway? It's fast, convenient and safe ( as you know, New York is America's safest big city ), plus I get lots of reading done there.

After the game we'll probably get something to eat since he's always so hungry. Sometimes we order in from our favorite neighborhood restaurants, but it's always a struggle which one to pick! Vietnamese, Korean, Peruvian, Greek, Japanese, Italian, Middle Eastern, Indian, deli, pizza -- so much to choose from! Thank goodness The New York Times has that wonderful food section every Wednesday; it gives us so many ideas. It's actually my favorite section after Tuesday's Science Times. Do you read the NYTimes?

Anyway, thanks for taking the time to read this. Good luck getting your word out to the American people.

Oh, and we actually have a word we use for you here in New York. Schmuck. You might hear it if you ever have the chutzpah to step foot in NYC again. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
(CNN) "Remember: This can only end badly." That's what my husband says anytime I start a story. He's right.

So. This carpenter is sitting on a sidewalk in Midtown Manhattan with his buddies, half a dozen subcontractors in hard hats sipping their coffees before the morning shift gets started.

The remains of a hurricane blew over the city the day before, halting construction, but now it's back to business on the office tower they've been building for eight months.

As the sun comes up and the traffic din grows, a new noise punctures the hum of taxis and buses: a metallic creak, not immediately menacing.

The creak turns into a groan, and somebody yells.

Judy Melinek

The workers can't hear too well over the diesel noise and gusting wind, but they can tell the voice is directed at them. The groan sharpens to a screech. The men look up -- then jump to their feet and sprint off, their coffee flying everywhere. The carpenter chooses the wrong direction.

With an earthshaking crash, the derrick of a 383-foot-tall construction crane slams down on James Friarson's head. I arrived at this gruesome scene two hours later with a team of MLIs, medicolegal investigators from the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner.

The crane had fallen directly across a busy intersection at rush hour and the police had shut it down, snarling traffic in all directions.

The MLI driving the morgue van cursed like a sailor as he inched us the last few blocks to the cordon line. Medicolegal investigators are the medical examiner's first responders, going to the site of an untimely death, examining and documenting everything there, and transporting the body back to the city morgue for autopsy.

I was starting a monthlong program designed to introduce young doctors to the world of forensic death investigation and had never worked outside a hospital.

"Doc," the MLI behind the wheel said to me at one hopelessly gridlocked corner, "I hope you don't turn out to be a black cloud. Yesterday all we had to do was scoop up one little old lady from Beth Israel ER." Today, we get this."

"Watch your step," a police officer warned when I got out of the van. The steel boom had punched a foot-deep hole in the sidewalk when it came down on Friarson. A hard hat was still there, lying on its side in a pool of blood and brains, coffee and doughnuts.

I had spent the previous four years training as a hospital pathologist in a fluorescent-lit world of sterile labs and blue scrubs. Now I found myself at a windy crime scene in the middle of Manhattan rush hour, gore on the sidewalk, blue lights and yellow tape, in a crowd of gawkers and grim cops.

I was hooked.

I'm not a ghoulish person. I'm a guileless, sunny optimist, in fact. When I first started training in death investigation, my husband, T.J., worried my new job would change the way I looked at the world. He feared that after a few months of hearing about the myriad ways New Yorkers die, the two of us would start looking up nervously for window air conditioners to fall on our heads.

Maybe we'd steer our toddler son's stroller around sidewalk grates instead of rolling over them. We would, he was sure, never again set foot in murderous Central Park. "You're going to turn me into one of those crazy people who leaves the house wearing a surgical mask and gloves," T.J. declared during a West Nile virus scare.

Instead, my experience had the opposite effect—it freed us from our six o'clock news phobias.

Once I became an eyewitness to death, I found that nearly every unexpected fatality I investigated was either the result of something dangerously mundane, or of something predictably hazardous.

So don't jaywalk. Wear your seat belt when you drive. Better yet, stay out of your car and get some exercise. Watch your weight. If you're a smoker, stop right now. If you aren't, don't start.

Guns put holes in people. Drugs are bad. You know that yellow line on the subway platform? It's there for a reason. Staying alive, as it turns out, is mostly common sense. Mostly. As I would also learn at the New York City Office of Chief Medical Examiner, undetected anatomical defects do occasionally cause otherwise healthy people to drop dead.

One-in-a-million fatal diseases crop up, and New York has eight million people. There are open manholes. Stray bullets. There are crane accidents.

"I don't understand how you can do it," friends—even fellow physicians—tell me. But all doctors learn to objectify their patients to a certain extent. You have to suppress your emotional responses or you wouldn't be able to do your job. In some ways it's easier for me, because a dead body really is an object, no longer a person at all. More important, that dead body is not my only patient.

The survivors are the ones who really matter. I work for them too.

John McWhorter teaches linguistics, American studies, philosophy and music history at Columbia University and is the author of "The Language Hoax: Why the World Looks the Same in Any Language." The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.

(CNN) Language changes with the times, and when it comes to our conceptions of gender, the times are most certainly changing.

We are opening up to the idea that binary conceptions of gender are unnecessarily rigid and don't correspond to the self-image of a great many people, and even that people's sense of their gender may not correspond to their biological sex. In this new world, a bland opposition between "he" and "she" seems increasingly antique, and even insulting, to many.

However, doing something about that is going to be a challenge. We are dealing not with merely giving new names to new things or actions, which is easy, but with using new pronouns, which is very hard.

This is hard because human cognition makes some parts of language more resistant to change than others. Nouns, verbs and adjectives, for example, are like software. It feels natural to add them, subtract them, revise them.

We expect them to change from era to era -- of course we now have blogs and twerking when we didn't 20 years ago; of course young people now call "fierce" what their equivalents long ago called "keen," "neat," "wicked," "rad," and so on. They are what linguists call open class words.

Pronouns, however, are closed class words. As shorthand for any thing or concept, pronouns are used so often and so unconsciously that they are more like hardware. A new object or practice is one thing -- but a new "you" or a new "him" or "her"?

It's harder to wrap our minds around changing something so cognitively fundamental, just as one does not pop up with new prepositions: You might wish there were a little word to indicate "on as in upside down on a ceiling, rather than on a wall or floor." But if you made one up it wouldn't catch on -- nouns and verbs are lightbulbs; prepositions are the wiring inside the walls.

Six-thousand years ago, in the ancestor of most of today's European languages on the Ukranian steppes, while most of the language would have seemed like Hittite to us (because it sort of was!), its speakers were using pronouns that sounded roughly like "me," "you," and "we" (not to mention the "tu" familiar from French and Spanish). That's how hardy pronouns are.

This is why previous attempts to fashion gender-neutral pronouns haven't caught on (believe it or not, there were once calls for the blend hesh!), and why as clever as today's "ze" is, its evolution from in-house tradition to society-wide acceptance will be slow at least, and possibly ill-fated. Bias alone will play its part, surely, but even without it, new pronouns require a mental effort analogous to conceiving dimensions beyond the third.

If anglophones are to accept new pronouns for new times, two things will be necessary. For example, the truth is that one thing that helps people change their pronoun usage is shame. For example, of all the "blackboard grammar" rules that English speakers are schooled in, such as that two negatives mean a positive or that one must say fewer books rather than less books, only one has truly caught on to the extent that it is part of the grammar actual people use comfortably. It is the rule stipulating that one must say "Billy and I went to the store" rather than "Billy and me," because me is "wrong" as a subject.

This is a rule no one imposed on English until a couple hundred years ago, and is unheard of in many other languages like French and Swedish. However, for better or for worse, it has been so successfully drilled into our heads as a mark of basic intelligence and propriety.

Now, I would hope that pronouns like "ze" would not be imposed with the knuckle-rapping and contemptuous indignation with which the Billy and I rule has been promulgated. However, there is room for presenting "ze" as a matter not of fashion, but of basic civility -- people must think of new pronouns as the proper thing to do, not as a stunt.

To the extent that societies change their pronoun usage, it tends to involve recasting old pronouns, or even expressions, into new functions. European languages like French, for example, use the plural "vous" to address a single person with respect. Spanish's respectful "usted" began as "your mercy," "vuestra merced," not as a brand new little word imposed by fiat. In this light, our own "they" could be handy as a new way to address people gender-neutrally. Many have called for exactly this.

And not just recently -- English speakers have been using "they" in the singular for eons. In starchy old "Vanity Fair," William Thackeray writes "A person can't help their birth." Today, we spontaneously use sentences such as "Tell each student they should hand in the paper on Tuesday." However, this is another of those things that we are told is a mark of ignorance because "they is plural." However, our new times may require that we get past that notion, which shouldn't be a problem because it has always been absurd.

After all, in French, vous "is plural," yet no one seems to mind. Once upon a time, you "was plural" while thou was used in the singular. Today, you "is" singular as well and no one bats an eye. In the same way, in our "hardware," "they" is both singular and plural. Our new conceptions of gender are a good time to get past the conservatism about singular "they."

The naysayers complain about the prospect of sentences like "They is upstairs," but this is a distraction: gender-neutral they should be used, as it has been forever, with plural verb forms: "They are upstairs" will mean that one person is upstairs as well as two or more. "But won't that be confusing?" one may ask -- upon which the answer is another question: When have you been confused as to whether "You are my favorite" referred to yourself or yourself and some other people? Context pulls a great deal of weight in how we communicate.

Assessing the prospects of new pronouns like ze and recast pronouns like they, my bet would be on they, in terms of the chances that, in 50 years, everybody is on board and on to the next controversy. What we do know, however, is that we are at a point where anglophones will need to accept some kind of change in how we use the language. Call it a teaching moment --language not only never stops changing, but could not. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

Photos: NASA's Mars Curiosity Rover NASA's Curiosity rover found evidence for what scientists believe was an ancient, flowing stream on Mars at a few sites, including the rock outcrop pictured here. The key evidence for the ancient stream comes from the size and rounded shape of the gravel in and around the bedrock, according to the Jet Propulsion Laboratory/Caltech science team. The rounded shape leads the science team to conclude they were transported by a vigorous flow of water. The grains are too large to have been moved by wind. Hide Caption 24 of 58

Story highlights David Wheeler: It's finally Back to the Future day and we can see which predictions from the movie came true

Luckily, many did not, he says. We don't, for example, have to deal with rehydrating our pizza, sleep inducing gadgets and Jaws 19

(CNN) Unless you've been living in a nuclear fallout shelter (remember those?), you're aware that we're celebrating Back to the Future Day. That's right, it's here: The date that Marty McFly and Doc Brown traveled to in the DeLorean in the 1989 Robert Zemeckis film, "Back to the Future Part II."

David Wheeler

Finally we have the rare opportunity to confirm whether a famous movie's predictions actually came true on a certain day: October 21, 2015.

While the movie nailed certain aspects of our time (including flatscreen TVs, nostalgia for the '80s, and even a successful Chicago Cubs season), we can be glad that not all the movie's predictions came true. We're definitely better off without the following inventions:

Jaws 19

In a memorable scene, a holographic advertisement for Jaws 19 terrifies Michael J. Fox. In the real-life fourth installment of the shark franchise, "Jaws: The Revenge," we're already forced to accept the existence of sharks that roar, sharks that follow people to the Bahamas, and sharks that have vendettas. The tagline for "Jaws 4" was "This time it's personal." Which invites the question: What absurdities would we be subjected to in the 19th installment? Sharks that leave a horse's head in your bed to "send a message"? We're better off not knowing.

(CNN) I moved around a lot as a kid. For me it was always an adventure. It was tough to change schools and continually be the new girl, but I found upside in every new place.

Boston winters were a nice change from Arizona summers. My school in Michigan was the best I ever attended. My ballet classes in Maryland opened a whole new world of training. And with my parents as the supportive constant, no move was ever too challenging.

Until I hit 13. We moved from Maryland to Massachusetts and I came into a new school in the middle of the year.

I'd always made friends fairly easily before. But this was different. The girls had long-formed cliques. The boys were in the middle of puberty and couldn't decide if they wanted to pull your hair or ask you out. High school was on the horizon and no one was going to let this new interloper upset the social dynamic that had been in the works for years. It was the worst four months I'd ever endured.

The pressure to fit in and be popular is as old as Methuselah. (Literally -- it was 969-year-old Methuselah who tried to persuade his people to listen to Noah, his grandson, about the coming flood. It was peer pressure of Biblical proportion.)

The pressure to fit in was why I made my mother buy the knockoff shoes that looked like the ones everyone else was wearing (but that we could afford). It's why I tried to befriend the popular girls who then turned on me in the cafeteria and threatened to beat me up after school. It's why I didn't tell on the boy who threw my science project out the window, in hopes that he'd spare my next effort.

As Marion Underwood and Robert Faris' excellent CNN piece makes clear, the difference now, though, is that the challenge of fitting in today has media amplification.

"Even before the dawn of social media," they write, "adolescents cared deeply about fitting in and were hurt when they felt excluded from face-to-face interactions or by seeing the popular kids hang around together. What is different now is that social media affords frequent opportunities for all teens to see pictures of parties they were not invited to and friends having fun without them, images they would be spared if social media did not exist."

So true. I can't imagine my 13-year-old self, naïve, insecure, earnest and easily-wounded, being equipped to handle today's unwieldy world of social media, where my shoes would have been blasted on Instagram, and my cafeteria incident caught on video and posted to Facebook and my efforts to fit in ridiculed on Snapchat.

But while social media may reach more people (my incidents never had the potential to "go viral") were kids like me any less traumatized by bullies because they had a smaller platform? Were the temptations to fit in any less great? Was being an outsider really any easier?

JUST WATCHED Teens' social secrets go deeper than parents think Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Teens' social secrets go deeper than parents think 02:10

Now that I'm a parent of a 10-month-old son, I'm clinging desperately to the prospect that by the time my little one is an adolescent, something will have changed for the better somehow. But I think that being 13 is always going to be tougher for some kids than others. The choice we have as parents -- especially as parents were either bullies or bullied -- is what kind of kids do we want to raise?

I could be honest and tell you I've had long conversations with my husband about trying to raise a "socially-adept" child, who fits in well, who makes friends, who excels in certain areas so that he isn't the target of bullying. But we've had longer conversations about trying to raise a child who is happy, comfortable, confident and secure, so he knows he is loved and accepted for who he is, regardless of anyone he meets who disagrees.

Looking back on my difficult year, I'm not sure I'd wish I could have been popular. I do wish I'd been a little more secure.

I'm also keenly aware that bullying has become frighteningly easy today. It's anonymous and instantaneous, with tremendous reach. Raising a kid who won't be a bully is far more important to me than raising a kid who will be popular.

I think I'm pretty tough. Mine wouldn't be the best job -- regularly dodging insults not only from social media trolls but also from colleagues with legitimate jobs (and, inexplicably, spouses who love them!) -- if I had thin skin.

There's name calling, of course. There are death threats, sure. But then there's stuff you don't prepare for, like that time a package arrived with bloody chicken parts inside. Or that time a pornographer depicted me in one of his magazines performing a sex act. Or that time Keith Olbermann suggested I should have been aborted. For real.

When we talk about bullying, it's hard to tell young people that all that much changes when you hit adulthood. I think constantly about raising our son in a culture of cyberbullying, cyberstalking, online harassment and general terribleness (and that's among the adults!).

Of course, we're tougher as adults than kids are, so we can handle this with more composure and aplomb. The high-minded mom advice to "just ignore them" rarely solved any problem at 13, but now it does in fact often do the trick.

As difficult as it was at the time, I know that my own adolescence prepared me for an adulthood where the bullying and bad behavior continues. But it's also informing how I plan to raise a child in an era of bullying.

Being 13 today seems totally overwhelming. But it was pretty overwhelming then, too. If I could tell my 13-year-old self one thing then (and what I will tell my future 13-year-old son) it wouldn't necessarily be that it gets better -- adulthood is hard and people are still jerks. It's that you will get better. Better at coping. Better at not caring. Better at negotiating these challenges. Better at loving yourself. Put most simply, better at being you. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) What the American public craves is authenticity: a sense that the men and women we elect are, like us, flesh-and-blood creatures who celebrate and grieve, who dance and despair. But it's rare to see politician reveal his or her vulnerability before a mass television audience.

And that is why Vice President Joe Biden's appearance on "The Late Show" with Stephen Colbert on Thursday night was so uncommonly moving. In the face of Biden's offhand honesty, passion and wrenching humanity as he discussed his beloved son Beau's death from brain cancer earlier this summer, it is almost embarrassing to acknowledge that it made for "good television."

It was life happening before our eyes, the kind of life we find in our own living rooms and kitchens.

Real conversation about the human experience is something we don't expect on late night -- from arch hosts, and particularly from politicians, who often seem like pieces of Styrofoam.

The Biden appearance slapped the nation awake, reminding us that we've become almost numb as we listen to the excuses, the prevarications, the bragging, the naked vanity that seems to dominate both major parties in this election season.

Is it just me, or has it gotten horribly worse Isn't this why we crave somebody like Joe Biden, somebody willing to reveal his pain, his fear, his frailty and nobility?

It seems unlikely now that Biden will run, not after this interview, where Stephen Colbert — the most gifted interviewer in America today -- brought up "the elephant in the room," which he cleverly suggested was really a donkey. He referred to the pressing political question of the moment: Will Joe Biden challenge Hillary Clinton and others in the ongoing Democratic primary?

A lot hung on his answer, and the whole nation leaned forward to listen.

Biden was shockingly frank for a man under the klieg lights. His face was extremely mobile, with a range of emotion flickering as he dipped his eyes to the floor and seemed to wince. A vast audience saw the obvious truth: Here is father grieving for beloved son, Beau, who died of brain cancer only a few months ago. The rawness of his feelings were vividly on display.

Biden was frank, saying: "I don't think any man or woman should run for president unless, number one, they know exactly why they would want to be president and, number two, they can look at folks out there and say, 'I promise you, you have my whole heart, my whole soul, my energy, and my passion to do this." One could hear a pin drop in the audience, which held its breath. "And I'd be lying if I said that I knew I was there," Biden added, more or less putting the kibosh on a presidential bid.

He could backtrack, of course, claiming that suddenly a voice had come to him from heaven, saying "Run, Joe, Run!" But that seems highly unlikely now. Voters would genuinely have to wonder if Biden really had the heart, the energy and the passion to give to this difficult and demanding job. Running for high public office can't be easy. And it's clear that even Joe doesn't think he can manage it in the wake of his son's death.

It's easy to say why so many like Joe Biden a great deal. I'm among them. He's a compassionate human being, and he's real.

Born in 1942, he grew up in Scranton, Pennsylvania -- the lunch-pail capital of the western world, in my view. I grew up only a mile or so from Biden, whose father scraped to find work during some hard economic times in this era, when anthracite mining had died out and left many in northeastern Pennsylvania without other options for making a living. My mother, who died at 97 only last year, was a friend of Biden's aunt and mother, and she recalled that they moved to Delaware in search of better work.

Like so many baby boomers, Joe was among the first in his family to have a college education, which he managed to get with the aid of scholarships, attending the University of Delaware and law school at Syracuse.

Ordinary Americans identify with Biden. He wasn't born with a silver spoon in his mouth -- like Jeb Bush or Donald Trump. He made his way -- slowly but surely -- in the often clamorous world of American politics.

Story highlights Mark Zuckerberg announced that his wife had three miscarriages while trying to get pregnant

Jodi Abbott, Eugene Declercq: We need to talk about pregnancy loss more; there is no shame in having a miscarriage

Jodi F. Abbott is vice chair for education at the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, Boston University School of Medicine. Eugene Declercq, founder of Birth by the Numbers, is professor and assistant dean at Community Health Sciences Department, Boston University School of Public Health. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors.

(CNN) Recently, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that he and his wife, Priscilla Chan, are going to have a baby girl.

In his public post that went viral, Zuckerberg wrote: "We want to share one experience to start. We've been trying to have a child for a couple of years and have had three miscarriages along the way. You feel so hopeful when you learn you're going to have a child. You start imagining who they'll become and dreaming of hopes for their future. You start making plans, and then they're gone. It's a lonely experience."

Zuckerberg's frank admission of his wife's three miscarriages led to a vast outpouring of stories from women and families who have faced a similar situation.

Millennials have become accustomed to posting their lives online, and yet, as they are coupling and starting families they are discovering that few experiences are as isolating as losing a desired pregnancy.

On top of that, there is a certain stigma associated with miscarriages, as though it's the fault of the parents. But it isn't, and the stigma will be removed only if we talk about it more -- openly and honestly. There is no shame in having a miscarriage.

Story highlights Frida Ghitis: Outrage over Cecil trophy kill went viral, spawned outrage backlash from those who say moral compass is skewed

What about human suffering in Zimbabwe, Syria, among refugees?

Frida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for the Miami Herald and World Politics Review and a former CNN producer and correspondent. Follow her @FridaGhitis. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers.

(CNN) Of all the stories you heard in the news in the past few days, which one moved you the most? Which outraged you, brought you to tears, led you to action? Which did you talk about with your friends, post on Facebook, discuss on Twitter? If the answer is the killing of Cecil the lion, you are in lots of company.

Frida Ghitis

By now, it seems, most people agree that the killing, apparently for fun, of the majestic lion by a Minnesota dentist visiting Zimbabwe was a perplexing act of pointless cruelty and cowardice. It spawned millions of posts on Facebook and Twitter -- a kind of outrage tsunami.

Cecil, who was apparently well-known and loved in the natural park where he lived in Zimbabwe, died in a most unnatural way, lured from his home and slaughtered. (The dentist, now perhaps fearing for his life, has apparently gone into hiding.)

The intensity of the backlash over the trophy killing has triggered a counter-backlash. Why, some are now asking, do people care so much about the death of a lion when so many human beings are suffering and dying? The surge of sorrow for a dead lion, they say, when compared to the relative quiet about other wrongs, reveals a moral flaw in our humanity, a defect in our moral compass.

It's also a key source of revenue. A recent study by the United Nations World Tourism Organization (UNTWO) compiled figures from government and tour operators throughout the continent to assess the state of the wildlife tourism industry. It found that the industry contributes 80% of international travel sales to the continent, a large percentage of the $34.2 billion African tourism industry.

Watch: Wildlife tourism is booming in Africa One of the best performing sub-sectors within the wildlife tourism industry is gorilla treks, such as in Bwindi Forest National Park , Uganda. Permits to visit a gorilla family cost between $500-700, meaning the forest, home to roughly half the world's wild mountain gorillas, generates approximately $15 million annually. Hide Caption 2 of 7 Photos: Big beasts, big business: The countries cashing in on wildlife tours The Serengeti-Ngorongoro southern circuit, a key migration route, is another tourist hotspot. It receives 300,000 visitors a year, spending $500 million in total on trips to the 300-kilometer stretch between Arusha and Serengeti, Tanzania. Hide Caption 3 of 7 Photos: Big beasts, big business: The countries cashing in on wildlife tours Of the countries who submitted data, 14 generated a total of approximately $142 million in entrance fees to protected parks, bolstering the coffers of various conservation initiatives. Around half of operators contribute to anti-poaching projects, and governments are taking steps to counter the elevated threat in recent years. Hide Caption 4 of 7 Photos: Big beasts, big business: The countries cashing in on wildlife tours UNTWO worked out that across the continent, the average wildlife tour lasts 10 days, has six participants and costs $433 per day.

Hide Caption 5 of 7 Photos: Big beasts, big business: The countries cashing in on wildlife tours There's more to wildlife tourism than safaris. Although 96% of operators questioned did offer them, bird watching tours, whale watching and a variety of treks also came under the UNWTO's census. One of the most popular non-safari activities in Zambia is a visit to Victoria Falls -- 30% of tourists will make the trip to the 1,708-meter wide falls, the " largest curtain of water in the world. Hide Caption 6 of 7 Photos: Big beasts, big business: The countries cashing in on wildlife tours Globally there were 12 million wildlife tourism trips in 2013 (the last full year of data available), and numbers are rising 10% annually, suggesting positive signs for the industry -- should it counter the existential threats to it, such as "the dramatic increase

in poaching and illicit trade of wildlife products since 2005," which "threatens to undermine conservation achievements," according to UNTWO. Hide Caption 7 of 7

This view is bringing together an unlikely collection of suddenly like-minded critics. From the left and the right, there is a growing sense that the outpouring of grief for Cecil is unseemly. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
A bunch of candidates who have thrown their hats in the ring -- Donald Trump, George Pataki, Carly Fiorina, Ben Carson, Mike Huckabee, Bernie Sanders, Martin O'Malley -- have little chance of winning, so one is left to wonder: What do they hope to achieve?

If winning isn't probable, what else can primary candidates intend to accomplish?

There are a number of things that candidates can achieve for themselves or their parties without actually becoming the nominee.

Selling a message: Often candidates want to make sure that their party colleagues are paying attention to certain issues. They feel that the existing leadership and crop of candidates are ignoring key problems that are central to the health of the nation. There are many people in public life who find this to be enough reason to undertake a serious campaign. This was why Sen. Eugene McCarthy of Minnesota entered the Democratic primaries in 1968, with the goal of making sure that Democrats who opposed the Vietnam War had a seat at the table.

Julian Zelizer

As a political veteran, Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont must realize that the odds of defeating Hillary Clinton are slim. Yet regardless of the outcome, he is bringing to the forefront of the party debate concerns about economic inequality, a broken political process and the rapid deterioration of the environment. Even if Sanders doesn't gain much traction in terms of actual votes, his ability to push Clinton toward dealing more squarely with these problems would be considered a victory.

Mobilizing new constituencies: Sometimes losing politicians help to mobilize new constituencies into the party. Ronald Reagan did this with right-wing Southern conservatives in the 1976 Republican primaries when he challenged President Gerald Ford. Ford defeated Reagan, though barely, but Reagan brought into the party and energized conservatives who ordinarily had not voted in primaries like Texas.

In 2004, Vermont Gov. Howard Dean used pioneering social media technology to attract younger liberals into the Democratic selection process. Although John Kerry won the nomination, only to lose to George W. Bush in the general election, the groups Dean energized would be central to Barack Obama's 2008 victory.

Among the Republicans in 2015, Sens. Rand Paul and Ted Cruz -- both still long shots for the victory against a Jeb Bush or a Marco Rubio -- have the possibility of reaching libertarian and social conservative Republicans who have become disaffected with the GOP over the past decade. Even if they don't win, they can bring into the party new groups of voters who can help the GOP in this and other elections, as well as their own future candidacies.

Selling themselves: There are some candidates who get into the primaries these days as a vehicle for their own careers. Donald Trump, the real estate mogul and former reality television star, appears to see the selection contest as a way to advance his own fame and reputation. Running for president has been just another way to keep his name alive in the national media.

Others, like Ben Carson, jump into the contest without a clear agenda or connection to broader groups. Their goal seems to be a desire to elevate their own role in the public arena. With such a vibrant world of political media, consulting and think tanks, running for president can enhance a person's stature and offer opportunities. Mike Huckabee earned himself a spot on Fox News after previous runs.

With Trump, one lure may be that he has name recognition and can likely get into the first GOP debate (on Fox, limited to 10 candidates) and the first tier of the first CNN debate (the network will have a second debate for those who don't make the first cut). That is priceless national exposure.

Another big outcome of a presidential run could be a vice presidential or Cabinet slot, and this must be on the minds of some of the longer shots. The visibility and stature that can come from running could enhance the appeal of a future appointment of someone like Pataki or Chris Christie.

Testing the waters: For many other candidates, it is clear that winning in American politics can take several tries. Entering the primaries and caucuses is a learning experience. When Mitt Romney ran in 2008, he believed that he had a good chance for the nomination. But even when he lost, the experience helped him be a stronger candidate in 2012, when he won the nomination. Running is also an effort to solidify the credentials needed to approach campaign contributors and super PACs in future years with the hope of being a credible candidate.

There are lower-key candidates, like John Kasich, Scott Walker, and Martin O'Malley, who have high aspirations in the near future but also realize that getting through the competition in 2016 can make them stronger for the next time around.

The primaries and caucuses continue to serve as a powerful national forum through which to achieve a large number of goals. Particularly in an age when there is so much politically centered media, constantly covering the endless campaign and giving attention to any candidate who enters, and when super PACs can single-handedly finance campaigns, the temptations to declare for the presidency are stronger than ever. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

Frida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for The Miami Herald and World Politics Review, and a former CNN producer and correspondent. Follow her @FridaGhitis . The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

(CNN) The calamity that has befallen the people of Syria has put the entire world to shame. The image of 3-year-old Aylan Kurdi lying facedown on a beach, dead, after his family sought to escape the horrors of their country's civil war , has touched the world. But compassion without action is pointless.

Thousands of refugees are battling European governments. Today, it's Hungary . Last month, it was Macedonia . Desperate people are paying thousands of dollars to traffickers to take them to safety; scores have died of asphyxia after being locked in trucks that failed to reach their destination; thousands have drowned trying to cross the Mediterranean Sea.

We are living in the worst refugee crisis since World War II , and yet the truth is that world leaders have failed to manage the crisis. They will, of course, answer to history. But in the meantime, the situation will only become worse without drastic action: More will die, more refugees will arrive unwanted, more countries will become destabilized and, if this goes on much longer, we will have a generation of Syrians who have grown up in the kind of conditions that perpetuate conflict.

It is too late to prevent the current crisis, but there is plenty we can try to do moving forward to try to ease it.

What exactly?

For a start, world leaders should convene a top-level emergency gathering to focus on the key aspects of this crisis. The conference should be called by a group of countries, including Germany with strong backing from the United States, and should include the European Union, the United Nations and other world powers, Syria's neighbors, and also Russia and China. The objective should be threefold: to stop the killing, to help the refugees and to bring an end to the war.

Arab nations must play a major role in addressing the Syrian crisis. We are all responsible. But the people of Syria are their neighbors, their brethren. The conflict is in their midst, its impact close to home. To be sure, the neighborhood has not completely failed Syrian refugees. The overwhelming majority of those who have fled Syria -- millions of them -- are now living in Turkey, Jordan and Lebanon, and Arab states have helped finance those costs. But more is needed.

Once convened, this international conference should work to develop a comprehensive international plan to help refugees, one that involves a much greater role for Arab and other Muslim states. Indeed, wealthy Gulf states should be encouraged to not just make an outsize financial contribution, but countries like the United Arab Emirates, Kuwait, Oman and Saudi Arabia should be pressed to welcome refugees.

Of course, Europe and the United States should also receive more from among the millions of desperate Syrian refugees fleeing conflict. But so should thriving Muslim states such as Malaysia, Indonesia and of course Iran, whose support for Syrian President Bashar al-Assad means it has additional moral responsibility for what is happening. (And speaking of Asia, this could be an opportunity for a country like Japan, with its demographic crisis, to boost its population, or at least do its part to share the burden of this major humanitarian emergency.)

But giving refuge to those who are fleeing the horrors of conflict is not enough -- the crisis also needs to be tackled at its source. So, to at least try to slow the killing, it is time to give serious consideration to the establishment of safe zones inside Syria, a proposal that is actually more complicated than it might sound.

For example, when Turkey proposed such an approach , some feared that it secretly planned to expel Syrian refugees from Turkish territory and send them back inside Syria to any safe zones. If the system is to work, these zones must come with an ironclad vow from countries hosting refugees not to force anyone to return to Syria before the war is over.

Safe zones will, of course, require a military commitment to be effective, perhaps from the United States, NATO and other allies, to guarantee the "safe" in "safe zones." They will therefore need to become no-fly zones, with air patrols and anti-aircraft support on the ground. The betrayal of so-called safe areas in Bosnia's Srebrenica must never be allowed to happen again.

Above all, though, it is imperative to bring an end to the war, to defeat ISIS and -- just as crucially, although this point now often gets overlooked -- to bring an end to the regime of al-Assad, whose rejection of peaceful demands for democratic reform laid the groundwork for this epic human displacement and for the upsurge in extremism.

Such an enormous movement of people is further destabilizing an already unsettled region, and bringing with it a level of disruption that could very well sow the seeds for another generation of conflict and extremism.

The West's initial approach, which effectively viewed the Syrian civil war as "their problem," has merely underscored how in reality there is no way to contain such conflicts within national boundaries -- this war has spawned ISIS, its videotaped beheadings and sanctioned sexual slavery , scattering its poisonous extremist ideology far and wide. And while an international gathering cannot undo the devastation that has been wrought, it can still be a positive first step toward winding down this conflict.

This is the moral and strategic challenge of our time. So far, the world has failed. But if its leaders can begin to publicly and materially empower those who stand for a pluralistic, tolerant and democratic Syria -- one that will eventually welcome back the millions of citizens who have fled -- then we might be able to turn the compassion we have seen in recent days into a more hopeful legacy for the country and its people. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Michael Smart is an assistant professor of transportation planning at the Edward J. Bloustein School of Planning and Public Policy at Rutgers University. The views expressed are his own.

(CNN) Imagine being able to travel from New York to Los Angeles without having to step on a plane, yet be able to do so in a fraction of the time it would take to drive. On the surface, that tantalizing prospect took a step closer with the news last month that a Japanese maglev train had reached a top speed of close to 400 mph, breaking its own world record in the process.

And the sight of futuristic looking trains whizzing past platforms at hundreds of miles per hour isn't confined to Japan: China, France and Spain, to name a few, have their own high-speed rail networks. Indeed, while these bullet trains may look futuristic, they have been around for decades; they're a tried and tested technology that the Japanese debuted over 50 years ago.

So surely it's only a matter of time before large numbers of U.S. passengers are doing a daily commute to New York from Washington and Boston in about the time it would take them to drive to work in their own cities, right?

Not anytime soon.

While several countries have undertaken the tough work of raising the money to invest in bullet trains, it's unlikely the United States will ever see the vast network of high-speed trains that blanket other countries. Indeed, passenger rail service in the United States lags behind much of the rest of the developed world, for several reasons.

For a start, much of the United States is not exactly an ideal market for high-speed rail. Compared to places where rail really flourishes -- Japan and Western Europe, for instance -- the United States is geographically vast. As a result, in much of the country, cities are far enough apart that air travel provides significant time savings, even compared to some of the fastest trains.

JUST WATCHED Japan's trains as safe as they are fast Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH Japan's trains as safe as they are fast 02:19

The layout of cities matters, too. When you arrive in Tokyo, Paris or Barcelona, it's often convenient (and even pleasant) to walk to your final destination. When it's not, a fast and frequent mass transportation system awaits to whisk you away. This is not the case in many American cities, where arriving by train typically means jumping into a cab or renting a car for the last leg of your journey. Simply put, in many sprawling U.S. cities, getting to your destination by train can still mean you've got quite a way yet to get home. We could change that. And we probably should. But we're not there yet.

Still, there are several parts of the United States where high-speed rail makes a great deal of sense.

The Northeast Corridor (Boston-New York-Washington) comes in at the top of just about every list of potential candidates for high-speed rail, with the distances involved being considered within the "Goldilocks" zone for fast trains. For example, at just over 200 miles from New York to both Boston and Washington, fast trains could compete with even faster airplanes by offering centrally located stations and providing an alternative to the hassle of airport security lines. These cities are dense, have strong downtowns, and extensive mass transit systems once you arrive.

Just as importantly, rail on the Northeast Corridor can also compete with driving, mainly because traffic congestion makes driving in the region so slow and unreliable, while tolls and parking costs can make it an expensive and time-consuming option. Rail in the northeast even has a great track record; after Amtrak's almost-high-speed Acela service began on the Northeast Corridor in 2000, ridership exploded, quickly outstripping air travel between New York and Washington.

However, the biggest barrier to improved rail service in the United States is simply the lack of political will. At the federal level, support for passenger rail service has languished and Washington has devolved decision-making (and increasingly, funding) to the states. With the nation's transportation trust fund nearly broke and no permanent solution in sight, it seems unlikely the federal government will champion high-speed rail -- a costly endeavor -- in the near future.

Without leadership from the federal government, the states are largely in control. Yet many of the most promising corridors for high-speed rail cross state lines, making it difficult to plan for better rail service. In 2009, the Obama administration awarded nearly a billion dollars of stimulus money to plan and upgrade a high-speed rail line connecting Chicago to Milwaukee and Madison. A year later, Scott Walker, the newly elected governor of Wisconsin, rejected his state's portion of the money and the project was, for the time being, at least, derailed. (The money quickly found its way to a grateful California for its high-speed rail line.)

Still, all is not lost for those hoping to see high-speed rail in the United States.

JUST WATCHED California's high-speed rail: LA to SF in 3 hours Replay More Videos ... MUST WATCH California's high-speed rail: LA to SF in 3 hours 01:17

California is committed to building its high-speed rail link between San Francisco and Los Angeles, paying for the line largely with state money raised by a new cap-and-trade market on carbon emissions. Several privately funded projects are also in the planning stages. For instance, a Dallas-to-Houston line promises 205 mph service in 2021 without a single dollar from the taxpayer. Meanwhile, another private company has already begun construction on a Miami-to-Orlando line with a more modest speed of 125 mph, with service expected to begin in 2017.

All this points to how high-speed rail will likely progress in the United States: piecemeal. It is doubtful that we will have a nationwide system of fast trains soon. And this is not necessarily a bad thing; through a combination of private and public action, we should target markets where high-speed rail makes sense. That means looking for shorter corridors connecting dense places with existing mass transit infrastructure.

High-speed rail won't be cheap, so we'll have to choose wisely. Some of the most promising corridors are also the most expensive; Amtrak estimates upgrading the Northeast Corridor to true high-speed rail would cost upward of $150 billion . Such an undertaking requires careful consideration of the economic, environmental and other costs and benefits of individual projects. But more importantly, it requires the kind of long-term planning that seems to have become vanishingly rare.

Thankfully, high-speed rail doesn't have to be an all-or-nothing approach. And while given the choice I would rather be riding Japan's speeding bullet trains, even the incremental improvements we've seen in services like Amtrak's Acela can make rail travel a lot more appealing for the hundreds of thousands of passengers who rely on it every year. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Carol Costello anchors the 9 a.m. to 11 a.m. ET edition of CNN's "Newsroom" each weekday. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author.

(CNN) The marriage apocalypse may be coming. Talk to any millennial and you can envision an America virtually marriage-free, with everyone happily single.

I did. And I do.

Recently, I talked about marriage with a group of journalism students from my alma mater, Kent State University. They came to me for career advice, which I gave them, but I also picked their brains about politics, religion and marriage. Their views on marriage intrigued me the most. 'Cause, guess what? They don't care what your generation thinks -- they'll get married if and when they want.

"I didn't go to college for four years to be a mom," 21-year old Candace Monacelli told me. "There's no housewife degree. I've worked my butt off for four years to get this degree. You want to use it. You want to be successful. You want to have that happy part of your life as well."

Jackie Demate, also 21, agreed. "I would have a very hard time justifying spending $20,000 on a wedding when I could go to Europe."

Carol Costello

At first I thought Jackie was kidding. So jokingly, I responded, "Wow, some people would say, with that attitude, you are undermining the moral foundation of this country!"

Jackie didn't blink. "But, Europe!" she exclaimed. "I'm really looking for a travel buddy. And I don't think you need a wedding ring to prove that you love someone. I see a lot of people get married too soon or stay together and are unhappy because they are afraid to be alone. And I would rather be alone, successful and happy than in a relationship where I'm not happy. ... I'm OK being single forever. As long as I'm happy."

Before you berate Jackie for prioritizing her love of travel over marriage, consider where she's coming from. A culture rich in divorce. In the United States, almost 42 million adults have been married more than once . That's up from 22 million in 1980 and 14 million in 1960. Percentage-wise, that means that among adults who are currently married, roughly a quarter (23%) have been married before, compared with 13% in 1960.

What a fine example my generation is! Not.

Still, there are no doubt more than a few parents out there wondering where they went wrong. Especially in light of a fascinating Pew Research report on marriage. When asked if society is just as well off if people have priorities other than marriage and children, 50% of respondents were OK with that. And of that 50%, 66% were adults between 18 and 29.

Religious leaders are deeply concerned for moral reasons. Economists are concerned for our collective future. Studies show marriage is correlated with economic well-being, though it is not clear whether the causality arrow goes from marriage toward economic benefit or in the other direction.

A study sponsored by the conservative American Enterprise Institute says: "From an obvious standpoint, households with two adults are likelier to have two incomes, improving well-being." On the other hand, the study points out, people who have money may be "more desirable marriage prospects."

Bingo on that point. The millennials I talked with prefer their partners to be debt-free and riding high. They also don't want to burden a husband or wife with their own debt.

"Right now, I'm 21 years old. And I'm thousands of dollars in debt," Emily Crille told me. "That wasn't something my parents bore. And it's really hard to plan a wedding, or even think about something like that when you owe so much money, you don't have a job, and you don't have a home."

I felt a certain sense of pride at their sassy attitudes. As a child of divorce I never wanted to get married, either -- until I met my husband at 38. But, when I was in my twenties, waiting to marry the right man and forgoing children put me decidedly and uncomfortably in the minority. I heard the whispers: Is there something wrong with her? Is she selfish? Unlovable?

Perhaps it is selfish to establish a career, travel and have a child on your own. Or, maybe it's exactly right.

Scandinavians are just about there. According to USA Today : "In Norway ... 82% of couples have their first child out of wedlock. The numbers are similarly high for Sweden and Denmark. While many couples marry after having the first or second child, it's clear marriage in parts of Scandinavia is dying."

The article also points out that "Norway ranked first and Sweden second in the United Nations' quality-of-life survey for 2004, which rates per capita income, education levels, health care and life expectancy in measuring a nation's well-being. The USA came in eighth."

In an effort to understand the joys of "sambo," the term for living together in Scandinavia, my producer reached out to Mikael Anteskog Adler, a 35-year-old man from Stockholm, Sweden.

"To put it short," he told us, "marriage costs money (party, clothes, rings, honeymoon trip, etc.) and gives no significant advantages, as there are no economic or legal advantages and no real social pressure to get married, or anyone frowning on premarital sex and cohabitation."

Wow.

Fifty-year-old Anne Lehes, from Gothenburg, Sweden, told my producer, "I believe that one reason for many Swedes staying single is because this is a secular country, so people think they will become fulfilled by their partner, and inevitably they get disappointed and then they don't think the whole thing is worth it."

Maybe Christina Hugosson of Uppsala, Sweden, sums it up best: "The notion that marriage is something that you're pressured into seems horrible to me. ... Marriage should be for love, not a matter of expectations, routine and everyday practicalities."

My Kent State millennials -- true romantics -- would agree wholeheartedly with Hugossan. Emily told me as much, "Marriage is about love. It's not about planning or timing, and that's what we're all kind of waiting for."

Marriage is about love, but you have to be good partners, too. And, as they say, sometimes love isn't enough.

Which brings me back to that idea of a pending marriage apocalypse. Would it be so terrible if we all remained single? If I had remained single? I thought about it. So did my husband. We didn't plan to have children, what was the point?

In the end, we made a decision based on love and practicality. A commitment would not only prove our love, but also force us to get through the bad times couples are sure to endure. Eleven years later we have no regrets. But, we are not you and yours. Would a society without marriage be just as well off as one filled with "I dos"?

I don't know. But I would love to know if you do. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

You see, I had been a Seventh-day Adventist pastor for 19 years. I resigned from my pastoral position the year before , but now I stepped away from my faith altogether. It was a gut-wrenching decision but I couldn't see any other way to find peace and clarity. I encountered major theological differences with my denomination and evangelical Christianity in general, including the way it marginalizes women and LGBT people.

I questioned the problem of evils and God's general silence and inactivity. I sought out more liberal theologies and found them to be the slow death of God. Now I had to face the very real possibility that God does not exist.

Would I discover that God was present and involved, or would I discover that the whole web of theological claims I had embraced and helped develop were false?

I was feeling small against the beautiful and terrifyingly indifferent sea before me. Then I started to feel grateful. "What are the chances that I would be sitting on this beach right now, looking at this remarkable scene of beauty?" I thought. I was struck again by how unlikely my existence is.

Story highlights Peggy Drexler: Male models at Rick Owens' Paris runway show wore clothes that exposed their penises

She says as we become harder to shock, the culture keeps going lower and lower. The bottom is in sight

Peggy Drexler is the author of "Our Fathers, Ourselves: Daughters, Fathers, and the Changing American Family" and "Raising Boys Without Men." She is an assistant professor of psychology at Weill Medical College of Cornell University and a former gender scholar at Stanford University. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer.

(CNN) In Paris on Thursday, fashion designer Rick Owens gave audiences quite a show when he sent male models down the runway wearing clothes with peepholes that offered a glimpse of the guys' formerly private parts.

"Nudity is the most simple and primal gesture -- it packs a punch," Owens said of his decision to have his models bare all. "It's powerful. ... Who else can really get away with this stuff? It's a corporate world!"

The looks were simply for shock and awe and the attention such reactions generate -- after all, they can't be worn out in public and won't be sold in stores. But let's be honest: Were we even shocked? After all, female models have been asked to sashay down runways in states of near nakedness for years.

Meanwhile, more and more films are featuring full frontal male nudity. There was Michael Fassbender in "Shame," of course. And who can forget the uproar over the cameo of Ben Affleck's penis in "Gone Girl," albeit so brief one had to know the precise moment to look for it? And if we've seen Ben Affleck's penis, who cares about some male model's?

Of course, women have been going full frontal in films for years.

The opinions in this commentary are solely those of the author.

(CNN) -- Some revolutions happen in a single day; others over decades. The rise of the voluntarily single woman has been happening in Western societies slowly, over time, concomitant with well-paying jobs, legal protection from economic or physical abuse, reliable birth control and the possibility of fulfilling careers and adventures.

Women are marrying at a later age these days, cohabiting with their partners or going in and out of short-term relationships without ever walking down the aisle.

Currently, 53% of women over 18 are in the singles column. Put another way, women now have choices that allow them to customize the arc of their lives and some of them find that it is best for them to put marriage aside.

Is this natural? Is this bad? Is this cause for alarm?

We have long counted on women's sacrifices and the compromises they've made to lift societies all over the world. We are worried that if women delay or forgo marriage, the all-important family unit will suffer.

As much as I admire happy couples and families, I think this may be one of the few times in history when so many women could choose from such a full range of life choices without penalty or stigma. Since few people "have it all," why not choose being single if that's the best option?

What it comes down to is people get married when it's a good deal. The question is why isn't marriage a good deal anymore? Here are some considerations.

1. A useless husband

If a woman is poor and only meets equally poor or poorer men, she's in a tough spot. It is no secret that many women do not choose to marry if the available partners will make their economic situation worse.

In some of these cases, even if a woman has a child, she may be better off with government help than a nonworking, noninvolved husband.

2. Success changes everything

When a woman is very privileged or highly successful, marriage could come very easily -- or not. Think of the likes of Elizabeth Taylor, who was married eight times. Or Oprah Winfrey, who for personal or professional reasons, is not married.

Moreover, a woman doesn't need a husband who is a high-powered corporate attorney if she is a high-powered corporate attorney. Taking advantage of economic and professional opportunities could be undermined by committing to a partner with an equally ambitious, or different, life agenda. This kind of woman may wake up every day to new and exciting challenges and think, "best to wait."

3. Unwilling to make traditional compromises

A woman who doesn't want to settle for cooking and cleaning and being the primary parent that society prefers. She is not meeting guys who want the kind of woman she is.

4. The marriage penalty tax

Some women are in an income bracket where marriage inflicts economic costs. She would have to pay more taxes if she marries someone who earns approximately what she makes or more.

5. Avoiding cheating men

A few years ago when I was in China, I had a conversation with some very beautiful female Chinese TV personalities about their personal life. I asked them why they were single and if they wanted to get married.

The three women all said they didn't want to marry because "the men of our class will all expect to have mistresses, and it is better not to marry than have to put up with that." I have no idea if this was an exaggeration or not -- but they believed it.

6. Waiting for the "one"

These women wait for the perfect guy, or the guy who they would fall in love with and love them back just as much. If that man doesn't come along, they prefer to go alone. As women get pickier, more factors enter into the marriage equation.

They may find someone who doesn't quite go the distance even after years of dating. They cohabit with someone and it doesn't work out. Singlehood, never intentional, becomes a fact. But they will not marry just to marry as their mothers or grandmothers might have.

In social psychology, there is a classic theory called "exchange theory." It is a bit cold-blooded, but it predicts that a person's actions will be based on trying to find a balance of give and get. Each person's resources -- of all kinds, including money, looks, background -- are traded back and forth for a "good deal." For example, a "good deal" scenario could be a woman who makes an excellent living pairing up with a man who is a writer and is willing to work at home and be the primary child care person.

When women's life choices were highly constrained, they had little negotiating power. They had to marry or were seen as damaged. A few got away with being "free spirits" but usually they were exceptional in wealth or lineage -- and even so, it wasn't easy.

It's different now. While most women still want marriage, they don't want it at just any price. They don't want it if it scuttles their dreams. Marriage is not dead -- not by a long shot. It is still, to most of us, the house we wish to build for our love, our lover and our children.

But women want to craft a life instead of having it pressed upon them. And that means some of us will be single for a long time, and some of us will be single for life.

Zimbabwe's health workers wear protective suits during a training exercise.

(CNN) A prominent 30-year-old television journalist has died in Zimbabwe after contracting the new coronavirus infection, the first person to die in the country from the virus.

Zororo Makamba was one of the two people who tested positive for coronavirus on Saturday.

He was admitted to hospital in the capital Harare after exhibiting flu-like symptoms last Thursday, the health ministry said in a statement.

Makamba contracted the disease while he was in New York and was in isolation at Wilkins hospital, Harare's only isolation facility.

A childhood friend of Makamba's told CNN he was suffering from a rare condition known as Myasthenia gravis, a chronic, neuromuscular illness, and had undergone surgery to remove a tumor from his chest last year.

Johannesburg (CNN) South Africa will enforce a three-week lockdown over coronavirus, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced Monday.

In a televised address to the nation, Ramaphosa said the 21-day lockdown will begin at midnight Thursday and he called on the country to "urgently and dramatically" escalate its response.

"Immediate, swift and extraordinary action is required if we are to avoid human costs of this virus," said Ramaphosa, adding that if the nation failed to act swiftly, it could face "a human catastrophe of enormous proportions."

In the week since the country declared a state of national disaster, the number of confirmed cases has increased sixfold, Ramaphosa said, especially troubling in a country with a large immune-suppressed population of HIV and tuberculosis suffers.

"The action we are taking now will have lasting economic costs," said Ramaphosa. "But we are sure that the cost of not acting now will be far greater." <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
(CNN) Canada and Australia will not send athletes to the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo because of the risks associated with the coronavirus outbreak, the Olympic committees for both countries said in separate statements.

Both countries' Olympic committees also are calling for the Games to be postponed until 2021.

"While we recognize the inherent complexities around a postponement, nothing is more important than the health and safety of our athletes and the world community," the Canadian Olympic Committee and Canadian Paralympic Committee said in a joint statement Sunday. "This is not solely about athlete health -- it is about public health."

The Australian Olympic Committee's executive board met by teleconference Monday and unanimously agreed that an Australian Olympic team could not be assembled given the changing circumstances across the world, the committee said in a statement.

The committee also said "our athletes now need to prioritise their own health and of those around them, and to be able to return to the families."

London (CNN) In these times of extraordinary global turmoil , the weekend came as a welcome break for many. But anyone looking at the cyclists and runners crowding New York's parks, hikers thronging Britain's beauty spots and groups hanging out at California's busy beaches would have no clue that a dangerous pandemic has the world in its grip.

And as cases continue to soar, Italy offers clues to what may happen next.

When the outbreak in Italy began, authorities began by locking down affected "red zone" areas in the north. As cases continued to spread, the entire country was put on lockdown on March 9, with those who break the rules threatened with $232 fines and six months' prison time.

But hundreds of thousands of Italians have since been given police citations for flouting the ban, and a Chinese Red Cross official last week said Italy's measures -- among the strictest in Europe -- weren't strict enough. On Friday, the military was called in to help enforce the rules as deaths spiked and hospitals buckled under the strain. By the weekend, when Italy announced more than 1,400 deaths over a two-day period, authorities were forced to issue even more stringent restrictions on people and businesses.

While Europe has now taken over from China as the epicenter of the outbreak , many Western countries do not appear to have learned from Italy's example.

In London, where people flocked to parks to bask in a sunny weekend despite government advice to stay home, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson ramped up his country's response and essentially sent it into lockdown on Monday evening.

"People will only be allowed to leave their home for the following very limited purposes," he added, listing four reasons for which citizens can go outside; shopping for basic necessities, doing one form of exercise a day, providing medical services, or going to work if it is absolutely vital.

"That's all -- these are the only reasons you should leave your home. You should not be meeting friends. If your friends ask you to meet, you should say 'No.' You should not be meeting family members who do not live in your home."

He added police would enforce the rules by breaking up public gatherings and issuing fines.

UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock earlier said that citizens who fail to practice government-advised social distancing measures were "very selfish," while New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo described people gathering in parks as a "mistake," "arrogant" and "insensitive."

But Nick Chater, professor of Behavioral Science at Warwick Business School, told CNN that this did not go far enough, saying western leaders had been "very mixed in their messaging" as they gradually closed bars, restaurants, theaters and schools over the past week -- and urged the public to listen to the advice to help prevent the spread of Covid-19.

"When people are being advised quite gently to do something, I don't think one should view them as being necessarily outrageously unreasonable in going ahead and doing it anyway," he said.

"Because the message they're implicitly getting is it isn't all that important, because if it was really important, we tell you. So we don't say things like, 'we advise you to stop at red lights, we advise you to drive on this side of the road' ... We just say you just have to. If you don't, you're breaking the law."

have been advised by national governments to practice social distancing, and businesses told to ensure staff work at home where possible. Western governments have been reluctant to take the draconian lockdown measures that were quickly enforced in China after the coronavirus outbreak began. Instead, people in places like the UK, Germany and Australiahave been advised by national governments to practice social distancing, and businesses told to ensure staff work at home where possible.

Germany has implemented a "contact ban" rather than a full nationwide lockdown with Chancellor Angela Merkel saying in a news conference Sunday that the country would ban all gatherings of more than two people, excluding those living together, to "reduce contact" and curb the spread of the virus.

Monday began with horrified Londoners posting images of workers squeezing onto Tube trains -- which are now supposed to be only for essential workers.

Message for those relocating to the countryside. pic.twitter.com/pAHkbrDZqM — judy murray (@JudyMurray) March 22, 2020

Neil Coyle, an MP for Bermondsey in London, tweeted an image of a busy train and said he had asked the government to "consider prosecuting irresponsible employers taking risks with other people's lives and our NHS."

Outraged people on social media have been sharing images of busy streets and tourist spots, and branding those ignoring the rules as "Covidiots." Vacationers have been flooding to remote communities, raising fears that small hospitals could very quickly reach capacity.

Snowdonia National Park in Wales said it had experienced its "busiest visitor day in living memory" and called on the government to institute clearer measures and guidance. The mother of tennis player Andy Murray shared a photo of a trailer reading, "Go home."

So why hasn't that happened? Yesterday, California Gov. Gavin Newsom told young people at beaches, "Don't be selfish." Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon called on people to "do the right things now," and Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison criticized a "disregard" of social distancing rules.

But Chater says these comments aren't enough. "There's a huge communication failure," he said. "We've been looking at China, we can also look at Korea, we can see that there are strategies that actually do work, so it's not purely theoretical.

"In China, the main thing has been just a very heavy lockdown, probably a heavier lockdown than it strictly needed," he said. "But we know that a really severe lockdown will work. And in Korea, people have had much more freedom to move about, but they've had extremely vigorous testing on a massive scale. Probably a combination of those strategies is required."

China on Thursday reported no new cases after enacting strict and early restrictions, although these have left some residents unable to leave their apartments for more than a month and put the economy in steep decline.

Social distancing has been the most effective measure at keeping infection rates low in Hong Kong, though cases there are now rising again. New arrivals will be issued with an electronic wristband that monitors whether they violate quarantine.

Hemingway's, a bar in Hong Kong's Discovery Bay area, which has a large foreign population, last week issued a "warning to anyone returning from Europe" that CCTV footage of anyone violating the rules would be sent to the authorities.

Some European countries are now taking more action to slow the spread of the virus. In France, thousands of fines have been issued for those breaking the rules against all but essential trips outside, and more parks and beaches are starting to close.

But if leaders want people to do more, they must make it "mandatory," says Chater -- before it's too late. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Editor's note: Jim Bittermann is CNN's Senior International Correspondent based in Paris. He has lived there for 40 years.

(CNN) The streets of Paris are empty. The theaters and cinemas are dark. The cafes and restaurants shuttered. Museums closed. The parks and playgrounds deserted. The government has so ordered. Everyone you meet eyes you with suspicion. Is this the person who is going to infect me? Am I going to infect this person? Above all, the atmosphere here is very, very sad.

In the countryside, people typically greet each other with "les bises," the tradition of kissing each other on the cheek. Now they stand awkwardly two meters apart and talk loudly. The coronavirus outbreak is making people nervous and anxious and ready for any human, if touchless, contact.

There are the physical tragedies of the illness and its deaths, but there are the psychological ones too. For France, these are awful times. This is a supremely social country, but now social distancing is the rule of the day. So many French obsessions are related to getting together and spending time with each other... the quest for shorter work weeks, early retirement, more vacation time, all stem in part from a desire to increase time spent with friends and family.

Neighbors Alain de Gourdon and his family out for a walk while social distancing. De Gourdon's daughter holds up the paperwork needed.

Unlike some countries, where people often go out to put down as much food and drink in as short a time as possible, here making a drink or meal last as long as possible is the norm. You must have time to talk, laugh, sympathize and empathize. It's part of the culture.

This virus has put an end to that. Psychiatrists on television are warning about an increase in case of self-harm linked to the government-mandated lockdown and academics are advising how to use social media to help with mental health. The head of the French equivalent of the parent-teacher association was on the radio observing that forced confinement has led to a dramatic upturn in violence in the home. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Moscow (CNN) Russian President Vladimir Putin said this week his country managed to stop the mass spread of coronavirus -- and that the situation was "under control," thanks to early and aggressive measures to keep more people from getting the disease .

Does Russia have coronavirus under control? According to information released by Russian officials, Putin's strategy seems to have worked. The number of confirmed Russian coronavirus cases is surprisingly low, despite Russia sharing a lengthy border with China and recording its first case back in January.

The numbers are picking up, but Russia -- a country of 146 million people -- has fewer confirmed cases than Luxembourg, with just 253 people infected. Luxembourg, by contrast, has a population of just 628,000, according to the CIA World Factbook , and by Saturday had reported 670 coronavirus cases with eight deaths.

Russia's early response measures -- such as shutting down its 2,600-mile border with China as early as January 30, and setting up quarantine zones -- may have contributed to the delay of a full-blown outbreak, some experts say.

A strong record on testing

"The director-general of WHO said 'test, test, test,'" Dr. Melita Vujnovic, the World Health Organization's representative in Russia, told CNN Thursday. "Well, Russia started that literally at the end of January."

Vujnovic said Russia also took a broader set of measures in addition to testing.

"Testing and identification of cases, tracing contacts, isolation, these are all measures that WHO proposes and recommends, and they were in place all the time," she said. "And the social distancing is the second component that really also started relatively early."

Rospotrebnadzor, Russia's state consumer watchdog, said Saturday that it had run more than 156,000 coronavirus tests in total. By comparison, according to CDC figures , the United States only picked up the pace in testing at the beginning of March, while Russia says it has been testing en masse since early February, including in airports, focusing on travelers from Iran, China, and South Korea.

That's not to say there were no holes in Russia's defenses. Russia didn't start testing those arriving from Italy or other badly affected EU countries immediately, limiting its controls for arrivals from Europe to taking temperatures and imposing two-week quarantines. The majority of the coronavirus cases reported in Russia were brought from Italy, according to health officials

Distrust among the population

People have still been crowding the Moscow metro system.

Still, Russia contends with widespread public skepticism, a legacy of its Soviet past. On social media, Russians have raised questions referring to their country's poor track record of transparency, such as the coverup around the Chernobyl nuclear catastrophe in 1986 and the country's botched response to the HIV/AIDS epidemic in the 1980s.

Authorities have moved swiftly to counter what they see as misinformation. In early March, Russia's Federal Security Service and internet watchdog moved to take down a viral post claiming the real number of coronavirus cases was 20,000 and that the Russian government was covering it up. Facebook and Instagram users in Russia then started to see coronavirus awareness alerts linking to Rospotrebnadzor's official website.

News reports of shortages in protective equipment have also fueled skepticism. And some experts have raised doubts about the reliability of Russia's testing system, which depends on a single laboratory. A report by PCR.News, a media outlet for medics and healthcare professionals, pointed out that the only approved coronavirus testing system, produced by Vector in Novosibirsk, has a lower sensitivity than other virus tests, raising concerns about false negatives.

David Berov, the first confirmed coronavirus patient in Moscow, wrote on Instagram that his second test showed a negative result, while the first and third tested positive for coronavirus.

"The virus was confirmed in my third test, it was not seen in my blood but was in my saliva," Berov wrote on March 5. "As I was told, they could barely see it so that's why they were in doubt for so long."

Vector did not respond to a request for comment. The Russian branch of the WHO, however, told CNN it received the specifications for the Vector test kits and the laboratory had been placed on the list of approved institutions used to confirm the coronavirus.

Cover-up allegations rebutted by Kremlin and the WHO

Putin has put together a coronavirus information center in Moscow, pictured here.

Anastasia Vasilyeva, a doctor for Russian opposition figure Alexey Navalny and leader of the Alliance of Doctors union, made headlines with a series of videos in which she claims the authorities are covering up real coronavirus numbers by using pneumonia and acute respiratory infection as a diagnosis.

"You see they said the first coronavirus patient that died, that the cause of death was thrombosis," Vasilyeva told CNN. "That's obvious, nobody dies from coronavirus itself, they die from the complications, so it's very easy to manipulate this."

Moscow health officials denied the accusation and said they were testing pneumonia patients for coronavirus. The WHO's Dr. Vujnovic also was skeptical about Vasilyeva's claim.

"If there was a hidden, unrecognized burden somewhere it would be seen in these [pneumonia] reports," she said. "So I do not believe this is happening, which does not say that you might not see an increase of cases in the next period, because we have seen that in many countries."

Putin himself addressed the concerns about the statistics Wednesday, saying the government might not have the full picture but is not covering up the numbers.

"Here is the thing: the authorities may not possess the full information, because people a) sometimes do not report it, b) they themselves don't know that they are sick, and the latent period is very long," he said in a televised meeting. "But everything that is issued ... by the Ministry of Health is all objective information."

This week the numbers have surged, with Russia adding 30 to 50 cases every day, and the count will most likely continue its upward trajectory as Russia expands its testing. Nevertheless, the local representative for the WHO says Russia is still doing relatively well, as the country tracks cases with epidemiological links to travel or family transmission. On Saturday morning, Rospotrebnadzor released a figure potentially more concerning than the number of confirmed cases -- 36,540 people are being monitored for possible coronavirus.

Meanwhile, the government moved to impose more sweeping measures, canceling public events and closing Russia's borders to foreigners, with some exceptions. But politics as usual continues under Putin: the President has signed a decree scheduling a nationwide referendum on constitutional amendments that could see him stay in power till 2036 on April 22. The authorities have vowed to monitor coronavirus developments but so far have not changed the date. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) Health officials in Nigeria have issued a warning over chloroquine after they said three people in the country overdosed on the drug, in the wake of President Trump's comments about using it to treat coronavirus.

A Lagos state official told CNN that three people were hospitalized in the city after taking the drug. Officials later issued a statement cautioning against using chloroquine for Covid-19 treatment.

Please note: Hospitals Now Receiving Patients Suffering From Chloroquine Poisoning, Says Gov @jidesanwoolu 's SSA on Health, Dr @Oreoluwa_Finnih She urged people against massive consumption of Chloroquine as a measure to fight #coronavirus . pic.twitter.com/Q4vLS79KUs

US President Donald Trump claimed at a White House briefing last week that the Food and Drug Administration had approved the "very powerful" drug chloroquine to treat coronavirus

"It's shown very encouraging -- very, very encouraging early results. And we're going to be able to make that drug available almost immediately. And that's where the FDA has been so great. They -- they've gone through the approval process; it's been approved. And they did it -- they took it down from many, many months to immediate. So we're going to be able to make that drug available by prescription or states," Trump said

He added: "Normally the FDA would take a long time to approve something like that, and it's -- it was approved very, very quickly and it's now approved, by prescription."

However, the FDA after the briefing issued a statement saying it had not approved the drug for use against Covid-19 and is still studying its effectiveness against the disease.

Price hikes

Trump's endorsement of the drug led to a surge of interest among Nigerians keen to stock up on the medication, which has led to inevitable price hikes in the megacity of around 20 million inhabitants.

One man told CNN that in a pharmacy near his home on the Lagos mainland, he witnessed the price rise by more than 400% in a matter of minutes.

Kayode Fabunmi, a Lagos-based lawyer, said: "The pharmacist knew the market and was saying to every incoming customer, 'You know Donald Trump has said this thing cures coronavirus,' and the price kept changing.

"The original price was 200 naira (around 50 cents), then it became 500 naira ($1.38) then it became 1,000 naira ($2.77) while I was there," he said.

The Lagos State Health Ministry issued a brief statement saying there was no "hard evidence that chloroquine is effective in prevention or management of coronavirus infection."

Chloroquine is used to treat malaria, lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.

Malaria is an endemic disease in Nigeria and other parts of Africa and for many years, it was common to treat it with chloroquine. However, at least 40 African countries, including Nigeria, have phased it out as a frontline antimalarial drug and replaced it with other drugs following widespread resistance to it.

Lack of clinical evidence

While doctors in China, the United States and other countries have used the drug experimentally in Covid-19 patients, there is not yet enough clinical evidence that it's effective in humans or the management of the disease.

Dr. Michel Yao, Africa emergency response program manager for the World Health Organization, told CNN there are 20 drugs and the same number of vaccines under clinical trial, and it is too early to make recommendations about the efficacy of any for the treatment of the virus.

"The WHO's position is clear. Any medication should be based on evidence. We don't have yet any evidence from any of these trials that would allow WHO to do a formal recommendation. All these are in progress, so it is difficult for us to recommend at this stage that any of the medicine can be of use for the treatment of coronavirus," Yao said.

"It is too early to rush to the decision that chloroquine ... at least for WHO to recommend it for the treatment of coronavirus," he added.

Side effects

Fabunmi, 44, told CNN he had used chloroquine before to treat malaria and recalled that severe itching was one of the side effects.

"For two, three days you will be itching," he said. "You dread having a bath, you will scratch and scratch and you would have to take piriton (an antihistamine) alongside it.

"It's also very bitter. If you make the mistake of letting it drop in your mouth, you will feel the taste for a long time."

Nigeria as of Sunday has reported 30 cases of Covid-19 and Fabunmi said he feels better having his batch of chloroquine.

"I didn't mind paying as I just wanted to get some in case it will become necessary. ... I didn't want a situation where I will regret not buying it. Better to be safe than sorry," he said. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
(CNN) A prison riots in Colombia prompted by coronavirus fears has left at least 23 inmates dead and 83 injured, the country's Ministry of Justice said on Sunday.

Relatives of inmates gather outside La Modelo jail in Bogota, Colombia, Sunday, March 22, 2020.

There was a "massive and criminal escape attempt" at the Bogota's La Modelo prison, one of the country's largest and most overpopulated prisons, Justice Minister Margarita Cabello said in a video address. That incident resulted in the deaths and injuries. Cabello said there also were "revolts at different penitentiary centers in the country."

"Today is a very sad and painful day for the country," Cabello said in a video address. "There were no escapes. Nor was there was a sanitary problem that could have prompted this plan and these revolts."

Earlier Sunday, Colombian President Ivan Duque said security forces and prison authorities were responding to "disorders in different parts of the country."

Cabello said as of Sunday, no inmates or prison personnel have tested positive for coronavirus nor has anyone been isolated because of it. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
(CNN) Geologists in Canada have found that an ancient continent was 10% larger than previously estimated after analyzing rock samples dug up during diamond exploration work.

Researchers from the University of British Columbia (UBC) made the chance discovery while studying diamond samples from Baffin Island, the largest island in Canada.

They identified a new part of an ancient fragment of the earth's crust known as the North Atlantic Craton, which ran from Scotland to North America and broke up 150 million years ago.

The scientists said the samples they analyzed had a "mineral signature" displayed in other parts of this particular craton, a large block of the earth's crust that forms the nucleus of a continent.

Maya Kopylova, a geologist at UBC and the lead author of the research, said in a statement: "The mineral composition of other portions of the North Atlantic craton is so unique there was no mistaking it."

New York (CNN Business) Every respirator mask that's available right now should be going to a healthcare worker on the front lines, caring for coronavirus-infected patients. They should not be sold in stores to consumers, said 3M CEO Mike Roman in a CNBC interview Monday.

3M is the largest maker of medical face masks, specifically the N95 respirator mask.

Hospitals nationwide are facing an acute shortage of PPE (personal protective equipment) such as N95 masks, gloves and surgical gowns amid the coronavirus pandemic. In the United States, more than 38,000 Americans have been infected across all 50 states, and at least 414 people have died.

In light of this desperate need, Roman said 3M's N95 masks should not be showing up in stores, he told CNBC.

Roman said he was "disappointed" that the masks were selling in some stores over the weekend, alluding to Target.

London (CNN Business) McDonald's (MCD) and Nando's will close all their restaurants in the United Kingdom and Ireland starting Monday, including for takeout, to help limit the spread of the coronavirus.

Paul Pomroy, CEO of McDonald's UK and Ireland, said in a statement Sunday that the decision had been taken because it was "increasingly difficult" to maintain safe social distancing while operating "busy takeaway and drive thru restaurants."

The UK government has advised against all non-essential social contact and is urging people to keep a distance of at least two meters if they need to leave their homes.

On Friday, it ordered all pubs, bars and restaurants to close but said they could continue offering food and drink to go.

Nando's said in a statement that eat in, takeaway and delivery for customers "will all stop until further notice."

London (CNN Business) Governments and medical officials are scrambling to provide the public with accurate and timely information about the novel coronavirus. But those efforts are being undermined by the spread of medical misinformation and fake cures on one of the world's most popular messaging platforms.

WhatsApp, which is owned by, is coming under renewed scrutiny over how it handles misinformation as the coronavirus pandemic rampages across the globe, infecting more than 200,000 people and killing over 8,000, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University.

The platform is being used to spread messages that often contain a mixture of accurate and misleading claims that have been debunked by medical experts. The problem is now so acute that world leaders are urging people to stop sharing unverified information using the app.

"I am urging everyone to please stop sharing unverified info on WhatsApp groups," Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said Monday on Twitter . "These messages are scaring and confusing people and causing real damage. Please get your info from official, trusted sources."

The misinformation often arrives on smartphones in messages that have been forwarded by a friend or relative, and includes information purportedly from a prominent doctor or a friend of a friend who works in government. Many of the messages mix sound advice, such as how to wash your hands properly, with misinformation. One false claim that is circulating: drinking warm water every 15 minutes will neutralize the coronavirus.

Because WhatsApp messages are encrypted in a way that allows them to be seen only by the sender and recipient, public health officials and watchdog groups are struggling to track the spread of coronavirus misinformation. WhatsApp itself does not monitor the flow of messages on the platform.

"It is clear ... that a lot of false information continues to appear in the public sphere. In particular, we need to understand better the risks related to communication on end-to-end encryption services," European Commission Vice President Věra Jourová, who oversees the bloc's efforts to fight disinformation, said in a statement Tuesday.

WhatsApp says it has taken steps to curb misinformation, it is donating to fact checking groups and users can forward messages to special accounts that can verify information.

"There are over a dozen [local fact checkers] so far, and we want more to be able to do their important work so rumors are identified and countered," Will Cathcart, the head of WhatsApp, said Wednesday on Twitter.

WhatsApp is promoting the fact checking organizations and health ministries on Facebook, with free and special clickable ads that pull up a new WhatsApp chat with the corresponding organization.

Jourová welcomed the new measures but suggested more needs to be done to address the issue of misinformation.

"WhatsApp has informed the Commission about some measures it put in place to limit the spread of disinformation, but most of the problematic content seems to be the so-called organic content, i.e. generated by users themselves," she said.

Misinformation spreads

In recent days, CNN Business has seen multiple versions of a message with information purportedly from medical professionals concerning four young people infected with coronavirus who had been taking anti inflammatory drugs.

In one version, written in English, the young people are hospitalized in Cork, Ireland. In another, written in Hebrew, they are in Toulouse, France. Medical officials in both cities have dismissed the story of the four young people as fake. (For more on anti inflammatory drugs and coronavirus click here .)

One popular — but incorrect — theme is that "hot fluids neutralize the virus, so avoid drinking ice water," or that drinking water every 15 to 20 minutes will flush the virus to your stomach where it will be killed by acid.

An image spread on WhatsApp and other platforms shows an illustration of a human head and throat. The accompanying message, written in Spanish, claims that drinking a lot of water and gargling with salt or vinegar will eliminate the virus. "Spread this information because you could save someone," it says.

Other messages sent on WhatsApp have warned that countries will go on lockdown and that people need to stock up on supplies. In the United States, the messages claim the lockdown is part of the "Stafford Act" and that people should "stock up on whatever you guys need to make sure you have a two week supply of everything." The US National Security Council tweeted that this message is fake.

While similar messages are being shared via text and on other social media, their proliferation on WhatsApp and the difficulty in stopping them makes the service an outlier compared to sister platforms Facebook and Instagram, which have taken more robust and direct efforts to combat coronavirus misinformation. (All three platforms are owned by Facebook.)

How to stop the spread

WhatsApp, which compares itself to traditional SMS text services instead of social media platforms, encrypts conversations, meaning they only live on users' phones. Though encryption is seen as a plus for security, WhatsApp is blind to what's being said in messages — and that makes it difficult to police or moderate content.

On Facebook, third party fact checkers hunt down misinformation, and when they mark something as false, users are shown a message that directs them to a correcting or clarifying post before they are permitted to share the misinformation.

Cristina Tardáguila, associate director of the International Fact-Checking Network (IFCN), suggested last week that WhatsApp could include a message asking people "are you sure this is true?" before they send a message related to coronavirus.

But Carl Woog, a WhatsApp spokesperson, told CNN Business that it's not something the platform would be able to do because WhatsApp is encrypted, and that "passing remote judgment on deciding what can be sent and not be sent in a real time message would be unprecedented" for a text or SMS service.

Aviv Ovadya, founder of the Thoughtful Technology Project , pointed out on Twitter that WhatsApp has developed prompts for when users are sent suspicious website links. But the misinformation about the coronavirus shared on WhatsApp is often in plain text form.

WhatsApp has made efforts to assist health officials in getting accurate information to the public.

On Wednesday, the company announced it had donated $1 million to the IFCN, launched a coronavirus information page and said it would help organizations like the WHO and UNICEF provide messaging hotlines for people around the world.

Health ministries in countries such as Israel, Singapore, South Africa and Indonesia are already providing updates directly on WhatsApp, through automated accounts.

Last year, WhatsApp imposed limits on how many times a message could be forwarded, after viral hoax messages in India contributed to more than a dozen lynchings in 2018. Users can now only forward one message to five chats, and group sizes are limited to 256 members. Woog said these measures have decreased forwards on the service by 25%.

Ultimately experts say some of the best ways to counter misinformation are public education, teaching people about the coronavirus and how to be smart consumers of information.

But when asked whether WhatsApp would consider sending a mass message to all users, urging them to seek accurate information from official sources, Woog said it's not something they're technically able or planning to do.

"We believe the most important thing we can do is to empower health ministries and doctors to engage with citizens and patients right on WhatsApp," said Woog. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
Carrie Hubbard doesn't know when the next paycheck will come.

The coronavirus outbreak closed the mental health center where she works part-time and she doesn't have sick leave or paid time off. Now her home state of California is under a " stay at home " order.

"I don't have the money in the bank to pay the bills that are coming up," she said.

As a single mother of a 1-year-old daughter and a 9-year-old son, who, like her, is asthmatic and at a higher risk for complications from coronavirus, Hubbard is feeling fearful and overwhelmed.

Rent will be due, the car insurance payment, the phone bill. "I have credit card debt because I'm a single mom and that's what I have to do to survive," she said. "But I've never been late on any of my payments. That's going to change."

Efforts are being made to help Hubbard and the millions of people like her who are expected to lose income because of the pandemic

What can you do if you know you are not going to be able to pay all your bills?

Talk to your lenders now

Getting relief is possible, but you need to talk with bill collectors now.

"Companies are going to be more receptive than ever before because they are under extreme regulatory pressure to work with you," said Ed Mierzwinski, senior director of federal consumer programs at the US Public Interest Research Groups.

"First try to work with your company," he said. "Let them know you are having trouble making payments."

If you owe a payment to a bank or a financial firm and they don't work with you, complaining to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau may help. They may contact your financial firm about your problem, said Mierzwinski. "The complaint database works."

To get the federal student loan break, contact your servicer and ask about options.

"People should be aware there are a lot of different ways you can pay your student loan," said Mierzwinski. "You may qualify for a better situation than the way you pay your loan now."

Arrange for a break on housing payments

Strong measures are being taken to allow people to follow "stay at home" orders, even when they can't make the payments.

Mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac suspended foreclosures, ordered lenders to allow homeowners flexibility in payments, including offering them a break for up to a year, and suspended late charges and penalties.

As part of the package, they also put a stay on reporting late payments to credit bureaus by borrowers who are experiencing hardships.

"We are doing all we can to help those adversely impacted by the coronavirus, including by immediately suspending foreclosure sales and evictions during this challenging time," said Donna Corley, executive vice president and head of Freddie Mac's single-family business.

While Freddie and Fannie guarantee about half of US home loans, regulators hope the whole industry will adopt a similar policy.

This relief is available immediately for borrowers who are unable to make their mortgage payments due to the coronavirus pandemic, regardless of whether they have contracted the virus.

But you can't just stop paying. You need to contact your servicer -- the company you make mortgage payments to -- and work out a realistic plan going forward.

Use the check from the government

Dealing with a sudden loss of income when the government tells you to stay home is uncharted territory.

"The Covid-19 crisis is unlike any we've had in the modern interconnected economy because there are no categories for the impact," said Mierzwinski. "Millions of people will be losing income or losing their jobs."

More than half of the jobs in the economy are at high or moderate risk, according to an analysis by Moody's Analytics.

Since 40% of Americans could not cover a $400 unexpected expense prior to the pandemic, according to the Federal Reserve, this crisis will be felt almost immediately for the many people living paycheck to paycheck.

Without a robust unemployment system that can provide support to gig workers, independent contractors, part-time employees and seasonal workers, there is not a good way to get cash in the hands of people except to write them checks, said Michael J. Graetz, a law professor at Columbia University and co-author of " The Wolf at the Door: The Menace of Economic Insecurity and How to Fight It ."

The proposal to provide Americans a direct payment as a means of assistance is taking shape. The Senate is proposing "recovery rebates" of up to $1,200 for individuals and $2,400 for couples earning below a certain income threshold.

What people will do with the payment is up to them.

"You're sending it to people who don't need it and you're sending it to people who may decide to go surfing instead of working," he said. "But you can't make those distinctions if you want to get the money to the people who need it."

People like Hubbard face hard choices in prioritizing needs.

"Saturday was really, really busy," Leonard, the CEO and president of Stew Leonard's, a grocery store chain with seven locations across New York, Connecticut and New Jersey, said. "Everybody was exhausted after Saturday."

Sunday was a day to take stock of what was left in his supermarkets. As soon as they were back in order, Leonard had to prepare for another busy day. Before his stores opened on Monday morning, there were lines of people waiting to get in.

Amid the coronavirus pandemic, Leonard has seen spikes in customer visits. After a recent presidential address about the outbreak, people swarmed his stores, he said. When the stock market crashed and rumors spread about closures and restrictions in New York and New Jersey, the same thing happened.

As Americans grow more nervous about the implications of the global pandemic, and as the government puts extraordinary limitations on public life, customers across the country have been clearing supermarkets like Stew Leonard's of essential items. Toilet paper is out . Paper towels are out. Hand sanitizer has been out for weeks . Shoppers are snapping up nonperishable items like canned goods and cereal and emptying shelves of fresh staples like milk, meat and bread.

It's not unusual for grocery stores to see a run on items during times of crisis. People stock up ahead of hurricanes, tornadoes and other natural disasters. But natural disasters don't affect all of America, much less the world.

Food demand in retail locations is at "unprecedented levels," said Morris Cohen, a professor of operations, information and decisions at the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton business school. "There will be spot shortages caused by panic buying," he noted.

But if you go into a grocery store right now and don't see what you want, that doesn't mean that what you want isn't out there somewhere.

People aren't eating more food. They're just eating it at home. Empty shelves mean there's a bottleneck, not a shortage. Food that had been destined for restaurants, bars, offices and other gathering places will need to go to homes instead, and the system will have to account for the increased volume of groceries Americans cooking at home are suddenly buying.

But the supply chain is built for some disruption, and there's cushioning for it. Our food system can deal with the current demand; it just has to relearn how to distribute the supply.

As long as farmers can keep farming, truckers can keep driving, packaging can be made and supplied and grocery stores can stay open, the empty shelves should be just a temporary inconvenience. A major break in that system, however, could cause real trouble.

A network, not a chain

The current surge in demand may be unprecedented, but supply chains are built to react to disruptions. A bad crop yield or a factory fire could lead retailers to swap suppliers or turn to alternative products. Those types of behind-the-scenes impacts aren't rare. But they are rarely seen by consumers.

Major supermarket chains and retailers have networks that stretch into suppliers all over the world, Cohen said. If there are shortages from one supplier, they can turn to another.

To think about how supply chains work, it's best not to imagine a physical chain, Cohen explained. Instead, picture a network: "If one pathway is broken, if one link in it is severed, there are alternative paths."

Though Stew Leonard's is a fraction of the size of national grocery chains like Publix or others, Leonard also relies on a network for his products. That has helped him avoid running out of fresh food at his stores.

"We have had to switch over to other suppliers" for fresh staples like milk and meat, Leonard said. "What we've been able to do is get plenty of butter, eggs and milk. Meat we've had no problem," he said.

The shelves do have product. They are stocked. They are getting restocked on a regular basis. The supply chain in this country is very efficient and it's very effective." Greg Ferrara, president and CEO, National Grocers Association

Greg Ferrara, president and CEO of the National Grocers Association , which represents about 21,000 independently-owned grocery stores in the United States, said that his members have seen an "astronomical" surge in demand.

"However," he added, "the shelves do have product. They are stocked. They are getting restocked on a regular basis. The supply chain in this country is very efficient and it's very effective."

Over time, and if the situation persists, some food could be diverted from certain vendors to others. Food that had been shipped to corporate and university cafeterias, cruise lines airlines and restaurants could instead be sent to grocery stores and retailers.

Some companies are already starting to make adjustments. Baldor, a New York City firm which sells food to restaurants, schools and other food service outlets, is now offering delivery to individuals.

The existing supply "has to be reallocated," said Cohen. "There has to be an efficient way of doing that. And that could be a challenge because this is going outside the normal structure of how business is conducted." But, he noted, eventually a balance should be reached.

Shelf-stable goods makers react

As people rush to buy canned food and other nonperishable items, big consumer goods companies are trying to meet demand without needlessly ratcheting up production.

Bumble Bee Foods, which sells canned fish, "has seen a spike in demand," President and CEO Jan Tharp told CNN Business in an email. "We are in constant communication with both our suppliers and customers and have been successful at keeping up with the accelerated sale of our products."

General Mills, which sells a vast portfolio of well-known brands like Cheerios, Annie's snacks and pasta and Progresso soups, among others, is seeing "a short-term increase in customer orders in the US," said Kelsey Roemhildt, corporate communications manager for the company. Demand for soup, cereal, snacks and dry baking mixes in particular has gone up. To help meet that spike, General Mills is taking steps like increasing production of some items.

"Up until this point, the supply chain has been working remarkably well," CEO Jeff Harmening said during a discussion of the company's third quarter financial results Wednesday. "Food continues to flow, we continue to make it. Our retailers continue to stock as quickly as they can. And that all is actually working pretty well."

Harmening added that "we anticipate continuing production" as usual, noting that the company is encouraging social distancing at work and taking other measures to try to keep employees safe.

Everybody who works in supply chain just rues the day when this bullwhip effect gets started." Willy Shih, professor of management practice in business administration, Harvard Business School

Still, some disruptions are inevitable.

Nestlé, which sells frozen meals, bottled water, baby food, cereal, chocolate and other items, warned of delays in Europe because of border closures. But the company noted that in the United States, supply is "relatively insulated" because most ingredients are locally sourced. "Our factory, warehouse and distribution centers remain open, with additional measures in place to ensure the safety of our employees and business partners," a Nestlé spokesperson said.

And companies have to be careful about dramatically increasing production.

People only need so much of toilet paper or shelf-stable goods. Eventually, they'll start dipping into their own supplies rather than shopping for more, and demand will fall. Any manufacturers that hire more employees or open new facilities because they see the higher demand as a new normal could pay a price.

There's a name for that phenomenon, explained Willy Shih, a professor of management practice in business administration at the Harvard Business School. It's called the "bullwhip effect."

"Everybody who works in supply chain just rues the day when this bullwhip effect gets started," he said. "And that's in fact what we're seeing now."

The bullwhip effect is one reason it's important to tamp down panic buying, and try to prevent people from purchasing more than they need.

Rationing supply

Facing the surge in demand, grocery stores and retailers are limiting sales of certain items to try to prevent panic shopping and hoarding, and give them a chance to restock shelves.

Walmart said that some items, including cleaning supplies and paper products, are in high demand. It is working to restock those products quickly by sending deliveries directly to stores and prioritizing shipments to certain regions. The chain has instructed store managers to limit sales on high-demand items at their discretion.

Kroger is capping purchases of cold, flu and sanitary products. In a message to customers , CEO Rodney McMullen said that the company's supply chain teams are trying to make sure that items are available as soon as possible.

There are companies that may be weighing whether it makes sense to increase production in order to avoid the bullwhip effect. But others may not have that option. Some toilet paper makers say they'd been running factories 24 hours a day, seven days a week as their normal practice. For them, ramping up production would be all but impossible, even if they wanted to.

Farmers who raise dairy cows or cattle or grow produce are in similar situations. They can't immediately grow more crops or milk more cows. And they may not have to -— they just have to figure out where to ship their products. And their farms must continue to function.

Support for farmers

A resilient supply chain should be able to withstand shocks. But it needs enough food in the system to work.

So far, our fresh food supply has avoided major disruptions.

Jim Mulhern, president and CEO of the National Milk Producers Federation, offered a reassuring perspective on dairy production.

"Dairy supplies aren't experiencing production interruptions at this time," he said in a statement Monday . "The US food-supply chain is more than capable of meeting demand."

Before the crisis hit, US farmers were on track to produce record amounts of poultry, beef, pork and milk, said John Newton, chief economist at the American Farm Bureau Federation, which represents farmers.

And the food should be safe to eat. The USDA has said it is "not aware of any reports at this time of human illnesses that suggest COVID-19 can be transmitted by food or food packaging."

There's no crisis in the food supply right now. Our concern is what's going to come six months later." Zippy Duvall, president, American Farm Bureau Federation

Zippy Duvall, the Farm Bureau's president, said he's not worried about the short term — but he has concerns about what could happen months from now.

"There's no crisis in the food supply right now," he told CNN Business. "Our concern is what's going to come six months later."

A number of factors could threaten the food supply moving forward.

Tyson, one of the world's largest meat producers, warned in a recent SEC filing that "if a significant percentage of our workforce is unable to work, including because of illness or travel or government restrictions in connection with pandemics or disease outbreaks, our operations may be negatively impacted."

If farmers get sick or have to significantly alter the way they work because of safety measures, the food supply could take a hit. If transportation systems break down, or if truckers are unable to deliver products, our access to the food those farmers grow could be threatened.

Duvall is particularly concerned over a recent decision by the federal government to suspend immigrant visa services in Mexico, another attempt to slow the spread of the coronavirus. Farmers rely on immigrant labor, and Duvall worries that the changes will affect harvesting in the spring and planting in the summer. He recommended that the administration classify farm workers as emergency workers on applications for temporary agricultural work visas.

"Empty shelves can be frightening, but empty fields and barns would be devastating," he warned. Duvall noted that he has been pleased with the Trump administration's efforts to help farmers so far.

For now, however, the system is working.

"The supplies are there," Newton said. "The key is making sure that the supply chain remains very strong, and the key component of that strong supply chain is access to labor." <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
(CNN) If you're looking for a reason to care about tree loss, this summer's record-breaking heat waves might be it. Trees can lower summer daytime temperatures by as much as 10 degrees Fahrenheit, according to a recent study .

But tree cover in US cities is shrinking. A study published last year by the US Forest Service found that we lost 36 million trees annually from urban and rural communities over a five-year period. That's a 1% drop from 2009 to 2014.

If we continue on this path, "cities will become warmer, more polluted and generally more unhealthy for inhabitants," said David Nowak, a senior US Forest Service scientist and co-author of the study.

Nowak says there are many reasons our tree canopy is declining, including hurricanes, tornadoes, fires, insects and disease. But the one reason for tree loss that humans can control is sensible development.

"We see the tree cover being swapped out for impervious cover, which means when we look at the photographs, what was there is now replaced with a parking lot or a building," Nowak said.

More than 80% of the US population lives in urban areas, and most Americans live in forested regions along the East and West coasts, Nowak says.

"Every time we put a road down, we put a building and we cut a tree or add a tree, it not only affects that site, it affects the region."

The study placed a value on tree loss based on trees' role in air pollution removal and energy conservation.

The lost value amounted to $96 million a year.

Nowak lists 10 benefits trees provide to society:

Heat reduction: Trees Trees provide shade for homes, office buildings , parks and roadways, cooling surface temperatures. They also take in and evaporate water, cooling the air around them. "Just walk in the shade of a tree on a hot day. You can't get that from grass," Nowak said. To get the full temperature benefit, tree canopy cover should exceed 40% of the area to be cooled, according to a recent study in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences . "A single city block would need to be nearly half-covered by a leafy green network of branches and leaves," the authors wrote.

Air pollution reduction: Trees absorb carbon and remove pollutants from the atmosphere.

Energy emissions reduction: Trees reduce energy costs by $4 billion a year, according to Nowak's study. "The shading of those trees on buildings reduce your air conditioning costs. Take those trees away; now your buildings are heating up, you're running your air conditioning more, and you're burning more fuel from the power plants, so the pollution and emissions go up."

Water quality improvement: Trees act as water filters, taking in dirty surface water and absorbing nitrogen and phosphorus into the soil.

Flooding reduction: Trees reduce flooding by absorbing water and reducing runoff into streams.

Noise reduction: Trees can deflect sound, one reason you'll see them lining highways, along fences and between roads and neighborhoods. They can also add sound through birds chirping and wind blowing through leaves, noises that have shown Trees can deflect sound, one reason you'll see them lining highways, along fences and between roads and neighborhoods. They can also add sound through birds chirping and wind blowing through leaves, noises that have shown psychological benefits.

Protection from UV radiation: Trees absorb 96% of ultraviolet radiation, Nowak says.

Improved aesthetics: Ask any real estate agent, architect or city planner: Trees and leaf cover improve the looks and Ask any real estate agent, architect or city planner: Trees and leaf cover improve the looks and value of any property.

Wildlife habitat: Birds rely on trees for shelter, food and nesting. Worldwide, forests provide for a huge diversity of animal life.

Planning for trees

Nowak says there's a downside to trees too, such as pollen allergies or large falling branches in storms, "and people don't like raking leaves." But, he says, there are ways cities and counties can manage trees to help communities thrive. "You can't just say 'we're not going to have forests.' We might as well manage and work with the trees."

"You don't want a tree in the middle of a baseball field. It's very difficult to play sports if you have trees in the way. Or trees in the middle of freeways."

Nowak says we can design and manage tree canopies in our cities to help "affect the air, to affect the water, to affect our well-being."

Urban forests especially need our help to replace fallen trees. Unlike rural areas, it is very difficult for trees to repopulate themselves in a city environment with so much pavement and asphalt.

"A lot of our native trees can't actually find a place to drop an acorn so they can regenerate," explains Greg Levine, co-executive director for Trees Atlanta.

"That's why the community has to go in and actually plant a tree because the areas just aren't natural anymore."

The job is not complete when the saplings take root. Organizations like Trees Atlanta and their volunteers plan most of their year to care for these young trees until they're mature enough to thrive on their own.

"We try to prune trees for 10 years to make sure they get a good healthy structure." Levine adds. "We also add mulch around trees to help keep the moisture in the ground so the tree doesn't dry up. We have to have a lot of patience with planting trees around pavement, making sure that they can rise to the challenge. "

How you can help stop tree loss

Protect what you have: Nowak says the first step is caring for the trees on your own property. "We think we pay for our house, and so we must maintain it. But because we don't pay for nature, we don't need to. And that's not necessarily true."

Prune the dead limbs out of your trees: If they're small enough, do it yourself or hire a company. The risk of limbs damaging your house is significantly lowered when there's tree upkeep, Nowak said.

Notice where your trees may be in trouble: Often, you can observe when something's wrong, such as when branches are losing leaves and breaking or when mushrooms are growing at the base or on the trees. You can also hire an arborist or tree canopy expert to assess the health of your trees on an annual basis. Or you can contact your local agricultural extension office for advice.

Don't remove old trees if it's not necessary: Instead, try taking smaller actions like removing branches. "It takes a long time for these big trees to get big: 50 to 100 years. And once they're established, they can live a long time. But taking a big tree out and saying 'we'll replant,' there's no guarantee small trees will make it, and it will take a very long time to grow."

Allow trees to grow on your property: Although everyone's aesthetic is different, it's the cheap way to get cooler yards and lower energy bills. It's also an inexpensive approach to flood and noise control.

Nowak says he laughs when his neighbors wonder why their property doesn't have more trees, because "I hear people running their lawn mowers." Fallen seeds need a chance to implant, and constant mowing prevents that. If you don't like where a seedling is growing, you can dig it up and plant it or a new tree where you like.

Educate yourself about trees and get involved: Many cities have tree ordinances that seek to protect very old, significant trees. You can get involved by attending city council meetings. You can also help your city plant trees by joining local nonprofit groups.

Miami (CNN) In a city where "sunny day floods" increased 400% in a decade, rising seas are changing the old real estate mantra of "location, location, location."

In Miami these days, it's all about elevation, elevation, elevation.

And long before melted ice caps wash over Ocean Drive, one of America's most vulnerable big cities is becoming a test case for the modern problem of climate gentrification.

While some scientific models predict enough polar ice melt to bring at least 10 feet of sea level rise to South Florida by 2100, just a modest 12 inches would make 15% of Miami uninhabitable, and much of that beachside property is among America's most valuable.

Even now, as more frequent "king tides" bubble up through Florida's porous limestone, pushing fish through sewers and onto streets, residents are becoming more aware that their city is built on the rippling shelves, ridges and canyons of a fossil seabed.

"Water is simply going back to the same places it flowed ages ago," says Sam Purkis, Chair of the University of Miami's Geosciences Department. "The irony is what happened 125,000 years ago is going to dictate what happens to your house now."

The fickle undulations between city blocks could mean the difference between survival and retreat, and the rising cost of altitude is sparking a noticeable shift in community activism and municipal budgets.

In Pinecrest, artist Xavier Cortada installed murals showing how many feet above sea level intersections are.

Neighbors in Pinecrest formed America's first Underwater Homeowners Association (complete with elevation yard signs) and named a marine scientist as president.

Miami Beach is spending millions elevating roads, upgrading pumps and changing building codes to allow residents to raise their mansions by five feet.

But in working-class, immigrant neighborhoods like Little Haiti, year-to-year sea level rise gets lost in the day-to-day struggle, and most had no idea that they live a lofty three feet higher than the wealthy folks on Miami Beach.

They found out when developers started calling, from everywhere.

"They were calling from China, from Venezuela. Coming here with cases of money!" says Marleine Bastien, a community organizer and longtime resident. "We used to think that the allure of Little Haiti was the fact that it's close to downtown, close to both airports and close to the beach. Unbeknownst to us, it's because we are positioned at a higher altitude."

Pointing out a row of vacant shops, she ticks off the names of a dozen small business owners she says have been forced out by rising rents, and lists others who she says unwittingly took lowball offers with no understanding of Miami's housing crisis.

Marleine Bastien, center, protests with residents and activists against the Magic City plans.

After her community center and day school were priced out of three different buildings, she caught wind of plans to build the sprawling $1 billion Magic City development on the edge of Little Haiti, featuring a promenade, high-end retail stores, high rise apartments and imagined by a consortium of local investors, including the founder of Cirque du Soleil.

Magic City developers insist that they picked the site based on location, not elevation.

A view of downtown Miami and South Beach from a plane shows the oceanfront development of the past.

They promised to preserve the soul of Little Haiti and give $31 million to the community for affordable housing and other programs, but it wasn't enough for Bastien. "This is a plan to actually erase Little Haiti," she says. "Because this is the one place where immigration and climate gentrification collide."

She fought the development with all the protesters and hand-lettered signs she could muster, but after a debate that went until 1 a.m., commissioners approved the permit with a 3-0 vote at the end of June.

"The area we took was all industrial," says Max Sklar, VP with Plaza Equity Partners and a member of the development team. "There was no real thriving economy around these warehouses or vacant land. And so our goal is to create that economy.

"Can we appease everybody? Not 100%, that's not feasible. It's not realistic. But we've listened to them."

He repeats a promise to deliver $6 million to a Little Haiti community trust before ground is even broken and, as a sign that he listened to at least one demand, acknowledges that the complex will now be called Magic City Little Haiti.

But while Bastien mourns the defeat, her neighbor and fellow organizer Leonie Hermantin welcomes the investment and hopes for the best. "Even if Magic City did not come today, the pace of gentrification is so rapid that our people will not be able to afford homes here anyways," she says with a resigned head shake. "Magic City is not the government. Affordable housing policies have to come from the government."

"(Climate gentrification) is something that we are very closely monitoring," Miami Mayor Francis Suarez tells me. "But we haven't seen any direct evidence of it yet."

Suarez is the rare Republican who passionately argues for climate mitigation plans and helped champion the $400 million Miami Forever bond, approved by voters to fund action to protect the city from the ravages of higher seas and stronger storms.

Miami Mayor Francis Suarez championed a plan to tackle the impact of the climate crisis.

"We actually created in our first tranche of Miami Forever, a sustainability fund for people to renovate their homes so that they can stay in their properties rather than having to sell their properties," he says.

But that fund is a relatively small $15 million, not enough to dent a housing crisis that grows with each heat wave and hurricane, in a city where over a quarter of residents live below the poverty level.

What's happening in Little Haiti could be just one example of a "climate apartheid" that the United Nations warns is ahead , where there will be a gulf between the rich who can protect themselves from the impact of climate change and the poor who are left behind.

Philip Alston, the UN Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, said there was already evidence of how the climate crisis affects the rich and poor differently.

And he pointed out that those hurt most were likely those least responsible. "Perversely, while people in poverty are responsible for just a fraction of global emissions, they will bear the brunt of climate change, and have the least capacity to protect themselves," Alston wrote last month. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
(CNN) Rich people don't just have bigger bank balances and more lavish lifestyles than the rest of us -- they also have bigger carbon footprints.

The more stuff you own, and the more you travel, the more fossils fuels are burned, and the more greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere.

Jetting around, buying luxury goods, keeping mansions warm and driving supercars -- they all have a carbon footprint.

Oxfam has estimated that the average carbon footprint of someone in the world's richest 1% could be 175 times that of someone in the poorest 10%. Studies also show that the poor suffer the most from climate change

But some argue that the wealthy can do the most to help fix the climate crisis. Here's how they could make a difference.

Spend wisely

The buying decisions of the rich mean much more in the fight against climate change than those of most people.

Ilona Otto and her colleagues at the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research estimated that the typical "super-rich" household of two people (which they defined as having net assets of more than $1 million, excluding their main home) has a carbon footprint of 129 tons of CO2 a year. That's around 65 tons of CO2 a year per person, which is over 10 times the global average.

Otto noted that because the sample in the study was small, the numbers are illustrative. "Probably our estimates are even lower than the true emissions of millionaires," she said.

"Regarding their own lifestyle choices, the rich can change a lot," said Otto. "For instance, putting solar panels on the roofs of their houses. They can also afford electric cars and the best would be if they avoided flying."

In the study, air travel accounted for more than half of the footprint of a super-rich couple.

German architects Aktivhaus say this home generates twice as much energy as it consumes.

Rich people also have more flexibility to make changes.

"A high-income consumer likely has access and is able to afford more climate-friendly products or produce from local farmers," said Tom Bailey, who contributed to a new report that highlights consumption in high-income cities.

"High-income cities and high-income individuals also have the resources to trial new products, services and solutions," he explained, adding that they have the capacity to create a market for more sustainable goods.

Divestment

As well as choosing what to spend money on, rich people can choose what industries to invest in -- or not to invest in.

Oxfam estimates that the number of billionaires on the Forbes list with business interests in the fossil fuel sector rose from 54 in 2010 to 88 in 2015, and the size of their fortunes expanded from over $200 billion to more than $300 billion.

Steam rises from a coal-fired power plant in Germany.

But there's a trend of wealthy investors selling their shares in climate-harming industries, known as divestment.

Over 1,100 organizations and 59,000 individuals, with combined assets totaling $8.8 trillion, have pledged to divest from fossil fuels through the online movement DivestInvest

Among them is Hollywood actor Leonardo DiCaprio , who signed the pledge on behalf of himself and his environment foundation -- as well as a group of 22 affluent individuals from the Netherlands who pledged to remove their personal wealth from the top 200 oil, gas and coal companies.

"You don't invest in coal, you don't invest in oil, in gas, also in some car companies that produce normal cars, or aviation, so you direct the financial flows," said Otto.

And with divestment, a little can go a long way. "We did some simulations that shows that with the divestment movement you don't need everyone to divest," said Otto. "If the minority of investors divest, the other investors will not invest in those fossil fuel assets because they will be afraid of losing money ... even if they have no environmental concerns."

Wealth means power

Wealthy people are not just economic decision makers, they can have political influence too. They can fund political parties and campaigns and have access to lawmakers.

Otto argued that rich people could use their political power to instigate positive changes to climate policy.

"Those people with the highest emissions, they have the highest agency to change something," said Otto. "There's so much research about the poor, the impact of climate change on the poor ... sustainable development goals and so on. But when it comes to action and sustainability and transformation, the poor cannot do anything because they are busy surviving.

"But the educated, the rich and the super-rich -- it's a completely different case. They have the money and the resources to act and they also have the social networks," she explained.

Fund climate research

The wealthy can also support climate research. In 2015, Microsoft founder Bill Gates committed $2 billion of his fortune to fund research and development into clean energy.

In May, a group of scientists wrote to 100 wealthy charities and families in the UK to ask for an "extraordinary increase" in funding for environmental and climate-related issues.

"We implore you to urgently consider significant investment to prevent further ecological catastrophe -- whether through your personal investments or your philanthropy," the letter said.

There's plenty of incentive for the wealthy to demand climate action: A recent UN report warned that delaying climate policies will cost the world's top companies $1.2 trillion over the next 15 years.

Role models

The super-rich might also have an influence on other people's carbon emissions.

"High status in our societies remains associated with high material wealth," said Otto. "It's an aspiration to become like the very wealthy and you imitate the lifestyles of people who you want to be like."

For example, air travel is no longer only a treat of the super-rich. This year, budget airline Ryanair was the only non-coal plant among Europe's top 10 emitters.

Ryanair is among the EU's biggest greenhouse gas emitters, according to EU data. The rankings include power stations, manufacturing plants and aviation.

"We as a society have to search for new ways of leading 'rich' lives that are independent of material wealth," said Stephanie Moser, of the University of Bern, in Switzerland, who found that a person's carbon footprint is better indicated by their income than their environmental beliefs.

"We have to redefine wealth in our societies such that living a "good life" is possible without high greenhouse gas emissions," she said. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

Major events around the world have been canceled or postponed as the race to contain the novel coronavirus continues. The cultural sector -- with its numerous fairs, shows and festivals -- has also been significantly impacted.

Countless art institutions, museums and galleries have been temporarily shuttered. The Louvre in Paris, which houses the famous "Mona Lisa," is closed until further notice. A blockbuster exhibition marking the 500th anniversary of the death of Italian Renaissance painter Raphael was suspended just days after opening in Rome.

Organizers have pulled the plug on Glastonbury, the UK's largest music festival, which was celebrating its 50th anniversary. In New York, the lights are out on Broadway, with all performances canceled until mid-April. And fashion's biggest night, The Met Gala , has been postponed.

Of course, such closures can seem immaterial compared to the public health crisis posed by Covid-19 and its rising death toll. People are getting sick; they are worrying about how to stay safe, access care, look after loved ones or stay in work.

But culture, even during the most extraordinary of times, should not be overlooked. Rather, it should be embraced as means for respite, escape and nourishment. For a brief moment, you can lose yourself in the brushstrokes of a centuries-old painting or feel completely immersed at a live concert.

At a time when misinformation, polarization and blatant hate are particularly confounding, culture can be humanizing and educational. It's an alternative means by which to digest an increasingly complex and anxiety-fueled world.

Financial costs, lost opportunities

Disruptions to the cultural calendar will result in catastrophic financial losses. The Metropolitan Museum of Art, for instance, is bracing for a projected $100 million shortfall and possible layoffs due to the coronavirus, according to The New York Times . Culture, after all, is big business.

Cancellations don't solely affect ticket holders, but entire ecosystems built around an event.

In the case of Art Basel in Hong Kong the impact was felt on many levels, from organizers to blue-chip galleries, some of which bank on multi-million dollar sales, to the city's already reeling tourism sector (last year, the fair attracted almost 90,000 visitors from over 70 countries). Instead, gallerists have been exhibiting virtually via online "viewing rooms" over the past few days, during the event's original dates. Art Basel's global director Marc Spiegler said the rooms would help galleries partially recover sales in a "completely new environment."

"This is not the moment where we completely redefine what we do. We are selling unique objects to individual people, and it's a market which is based on trust not only on the part of the buyer, but also the seller," he said of the invaluable relationships built when deals are made in person.

"I hope that galleries have the time and focus to really think about how to digitally market what they are doing -- we'll help them with that. And in a sense, the fair business will continue, but people will have learned how to 'play' digital to ... supplement the business that isn't happening and hasn't been happening for a long time in the gallery spaces themselves."

While big players can likely sustain one-off cancelations, smaller businesses and young talent may be hit hardest. That's where intangibles, like missed opportunities, come in.

"There's so much that's unknown at the moment, but the rug was pulled out from under us when it was supposed to be our launchpad." Filmmaker Nicole Riegel

South by Southwest (SXSW), the two-week film and music festival, attracts thousands of visitors to Austin, Texas every year. According to the city's mayor Steven Adler, 2019's edition injected $350 million into the local economy -- making the decision to shutter this year's event even more difficult.

Los Angeles-based filmmaker Nicole Riegel, said the SXSW cancellation was "devastating."

Festivals are where "you get that special premiere moment, you get exposure, you get interviews, you get audiences ... there's a lot of work that can come your way," she added.

"There's so much that's unknown at the moment, but the rug was pulled out from under us when it was supposed to be our launchpad."

Riegel was set to debut her film "Holler," a coming-of-age story about a young girl looking for her ticket out of a small town in Ohio. A town, as the film describes , "where American manufacturing and opportunity are drying up."

The movie was five years in the making and cost $1 million to produce. "My film touches upon the reality of young girls who live in these towns across America and are slipping through the cracks of a fractured system that feels very rigged against them," she explained.

She describes "panic" in the industry, particularly among first-time filmmakers who are seeking other distribution channels, such as online streaming platforms, in lieu of screening at the festival. But that's not an option for Riegel.

"Everyone on 'Holler' worked too hard," she said. "I won't ... throw it online for free. That's insulting to the work of my cast and crew."

Rethinking models, new innovation

With large gatherings put on hold, creatives are finding inventive ways to engage virtually.

Berlin-based pianist Igor Levit, saddened by the thought of empty concert halls, has been experimenting with what he calls, "social media house concerts," passionately pounding out classical music repertoires on Twitter and Instagram Live "until we meet again to do this in real life."

Helen Marriage, founder of London-based public art practice Artichoke -- the creative director of Galway 2020 -- said that plans have had to shift, last-minute.

According to Marriage, about 20,000 people were expected to witness "Savage Beauty," a project by Finnish artist Kari Kola to illuminate the Loch Na Fuaiche in rural Ireland and its mountainous scenery. The colorful site-specific work, which was to be held over a four-day period was instead, documented and presented as a " special digital version ." "This way (we) could show that the organization still had resilience, is imaginative and is continuing to support its artists," Marriage said.

In Italy, where the whole country is on lockdown, artists are live-streaming performances in lieu of the Milan Triennale, which showcases architecture, design and art projects. "We see this (the quarantine) as an opportunity to question our habits in terms of exhibition-making and test new forms of cultural production compatible with the conditions within which we operate," the Triennale's chief curator of design Joseph Grima wrote on Instagram, posting images of performers in gas masks obscured by dramatic plumes of colored smoke.

"This is a period of experimentation," said the Guggenheim Museum's senior curator of Asian art, Alexandra Munroe, who pointed to virtual exhibitions and the #museumfromhome hashtag as examples of how visitors could still access art. Munroe also said that a "self-questioning" is taking place across the art world, particularly in regard to the necessity of international art fairs and their subsequent environmental impact.

"The combination of these disastrous scenarios for the planet, including the pandemic, is causing people to rethink what has become, in the last decade, a manic habit of participating in fairs that can amount to two a month if you are a large gallery," she said. "Is it worth the exhaustion, the travel, the carbon footprint?

"Being someone who has habitually gone to all of them, I can also say it's exhausting as a curator and consumer who is building a collection for the museums that I work with ... I think (the pandemic) is an interesting reminder that we all did our jobs pretty well before this kind of travel and cultural expectation set in."

It's a sentiment echoed in other industries, including fashion, where the crammed biannual cycle of New York, London, Milan and Paris weeks, one after the other, has created an unsustainable yet almost compulsory schedule for editors, buyers, designers and models -- to be seen and stay relevant. Then there are the exotic cruise shows , held in the summer and increasingly reliant on spectacle and traveling to far-flung places, from Fendi on the Great Wall of China to Chanel's runway on a man-made island in Dubai. Immersive technologies, such as virtual showrooms, are emerging as a potential solution for the months ahead.

"People aren't caving in. Everyone is doing something different, or experimental. It's a huge learning curve." Boh Projects founder Bohan Qiu

In China, where the coronavirus has upended life since January, creatives have already adapted to new working realities. Due to travel restrictions, many designers missed the US and European fashion weeks, but are now working towards Shanghai Fashion Week, which was initially postponed but is now set to open Tuesday in a largely digital format.

Bohan Qiu, who heads communications consultancy Boh Project, is working with labels to stage shows and present their collections virtually. Some of these will be elaborate, with computer-generated models walking against surreal backdrops. "People aren't caving in," said Qiu. "Everyone is doing something different, or experimental. It's a huge learning curve."

Younger designers, and those fluent in digital marketing, may have the advantage. "Right now, bigger brands are starting to suffer. They never really had this mindset (of having to go digital). But smaller brands, who are used to working with lower costs and building a strong presence, already know how to live-stream super well, and make a message on (platforms such as) Little Red Book, WeChat and Tik Tok," Qiu said, of the "flattened" playing field.

But even those adept at using digital technologies say that absorbing culture in person can't be replicated. Experimental Japanese art collective teamLab, which is comprised of self-described "ultra-technologists," develop immersive digital experiences, including a 10,000 square meter digital-only museum

"We have five senses. If you're close to (art), even drawings or sculptures, you can smell the paint. This is our principle, and we won't change this part," said teamLab's communications director, Takashi Kudo, who is looking forward to art spaces safely reopening.

In the meantime, he continues his "task" as an artist -- to create, even in difficult times. "I can't just sit down and be hopeless. I think what's more important, at least as an artist, is to seek out and affirm an idealistic part of humanity, and present an idea of the future."

If planting more trees can replenish forests and remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, then could we also repopulate the Arctic with ice?

That's a question posed by a team of Indonesian designers with an eye-catching response to the climate crisis: iceberg-making submarines.

The idea, recently named runner-up in an international design competition appealing for radical approaches to sustainability, is the latest in a series of new proposals for "refreezing" the Earth's poles -- from sprinkling them with artificial sand to blasting seawater into the sky to brighten the clouds.

Led by 29-year-old architect Faris Rajak Kotahatuhaha, the group envisaged a submersible vessel capable of producing 16-foot-thick, 82-foot wide hexagonal icebergs.

The process would begin with the submarine dipping beneath the surface to fill its central cavity with seawater. Salt would then be filtered out, raising water's freezing point by more than 3 degrees Fahrenheit, after which a hatch closes over the chamber to protect it from the sun.

An iceberg would then form naturally inside, before being ejected a month later. According to the team behind the project, the hexagonal shape may encourage the icebergs (or "ice babies" as Kotahatuhaha refers to them) to interlock with one another and form larger frozen masses.

It's an early concept design, and many questions remain. The designers are yet to finalize how the vehicle would be powered, though they intend for the vessel to be fully sustainable. But could the submarines, in theory, work?

Andrew Shepherd, a professor of Earth observation at the UK's Leeds University, described the idea as an "interesting engineering solution," though he questioned the project's scalability. He estimated that replacing polar ice at the same rate it has disappeared in the last four decades would require around 10 million submarines.

"That's a lot of machines," Shepherd said in an email. "For context, that's not far off the total number of Model-T Fords built in all time."

But for Kotahatuhaha, the proposal is not only about feasibility -- it's about finding a different way to approach climate challenges.

"The Arctic has lost ice from year to year in the last decade," he said on the phone from Jakarta. "So we tried to solve the problem through a different way of thinking.

"Richer countries have millions to spend on (sea walls and) protection, but what about poor countries with no budget for (defending against) rising sea levels? This is a problem the world now faces together. We have a different approach: Rather than defending against sea level rises, we think it's better (to carry out) some kind of intervention to tackle the problem."

Protecting the poles

A possible flaw in the proposal -- and others like it -- is that making ice does not significantly alter sea levels. If the ice is still floating in the water it formed from, then sea's overall mass doesn't change. (The icebergs would have to be "moved on to land" if they were to lower sea levels, Shepherd said).

But reversing, or at least slowing, the alarming decline of polar sea ice is about more than rising oceans. Snow and ice reflect significantly more sunlight than open water does, so bigger, frozen surfaces mean more radiation is sent back to space.

"If enough (ice) is made, then it could ultimately alter the planet's temperature, which could in turn lead to reduced land ice melting and reduced sea level rise from that source," Shepherd said, offering an alternative advantage to making icebergs. "But there are lots of 'ifs' along the way."

Farfetched as it may sound, the idea of re-freezing the poles through geoengineering is being explored elsewhere in academia. In 2017, a team of researchers at Arizona State University revealed a concept for a wind-powered pump that sucks up seawater and sprays it out onto the ice's surface, where it will freeze faster.

The scientists' research suggested that using 10 million of the devices could add a meter (3.2 feet) onto the surface of a polar ice sheet over the course of a winter.

Other proposals have focused on protecting ice rather than creating it.

Since 1990, British physicist John Lanham has explored a technique known as marine cloud brightening, in which particles -- such as the salt in seawater -- are injected into clouds to increase the amount of sunlight they reflect. Together with Stephen Salter, a professor of engineering design at the University of Edinburgh, Lanham developed a concept design for a floating "spray vessel" which could fire seawater into the clouds via a series of masts.

Brighter clouds could mean that less sunlight reaching the Earth's surface, thus reducing summer melting and encouraging the replenishment of ice during the winter.

Elsewhere, the US non-profit group Ice911 has spent the last decade developing a highly reflective sand-like material that can be scattered on ice to protect it from the sun's rays.

Last year, the group tested its "hollow microspheres," which are made from silicate glass, over 15,000 square meters (3.7 acres) of frozen lake in Alaska. Researchers found that treated ice was thicker and more reflective than untreated ice.

Detractors say that plans to refreeze the Arctic address the symptom, not the cause. Indeed, even if proposals did prove feasible, none would combat the carbon consumption responsible for diminishing sea ice in the first place.

As Julienne Stroeve, a professor at University College London and senior scientist at the National Snow and Ice Data Center, told CNN when the Arizona State University's team first proposed its wind-powered pump concept: "Global warming in response to rising CO2 concentrations would continue despite efforts to grow ice in the Arctic. Thus, the excess heat at lower latitudes would still be transported towards the Arctic via atmospheric and oceanic circulation and this would counter efforts to grow ice in the Arctic."

But for Kotahatuhaha and his team, big problems require bold innovation. While he accepts that his iceberg-making submarines are a "utopian project," he wants experts from different fields to help build radical visions into viable solutions.

"Architects cannot build skyscrapers alone," he offered as an analogy. "(They) need collaboration from civil engineers, electrical engineers, economists and others.

"If there are too many limitations, there will be no innovation," he added. "Innovation is the first step to opening (our) way of thinking, then technology and research regarding ... feasibility must be deepened." <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

During the Cold War, this plane could fly higher and faster than any other -- and 55 years after its first flight, it still does.

The Lockheed SR-71, designed in secrecy in the late 1950s, was able to cruise near the edge of space and outfly a missile. To this day, it holds the records for the highest altitude in horizontal flight and the fastest speed for a non-rocket powered aircraft.

It was part of a family of spy planes built to venture into enemy territory, without being shot down or even detected, in a time before satellites and drones.

The black paint job, designed to dissipate heat, earned it the nickname Blackbird, and paired with the sleek lines of the long fuselage, made the plane look unlike anything that had come before -- a design that hasn't lost any of its brilliance.

"It still looks like something from the future, even though it was designed back in the 1950s," Peter Merlin, an aviation historian and author of " Design and Development of the Blackbird," said in a phone interview.

"Because of the way the fuselage bends and the wing curves and twists, it looks more organic than mechanical. Most conventional airplanes look like someone built them -- this one almost looks like it was grown."

SR-71 Blackbird: Still the world's fastest aircraft

A CIA spy

In May 1960, an American U-2 spy plane was shot duown in Soviet airspace while taking aerial photographs. Initially, the US government said it was a stray weather research aircraft, but the story fell apart once the Soviet government released photos of the captured pilot and the plane's surveillance equipment.

The incident had immediate diplomatic repercussions for the Cold War and reinforced the need for a new type of reconnaissance plane that could fly faster and higher, safe from anti-aircraft fire. "The CIA wanted a plane that could fly above 90,000 feet or thereabouts, at high speed and as invisible to radar as it was feasible," said Merlin.

The task of designing such an ambitious machine fell on Clarence "Kelly" Johnson, one of the world's greatest aircraft designers, and his secret division of engineers at Lockheed, called Skunk Works. "Everything had to be invented. Everything," recalled Johnson, who died in 1990, the same year the Blackbirds were first retired from service.

The original plane in the Blackbird family was called the A-12 and made its maiden flight on April 30, 1962. In total, 13 A-12s were produced, and the plane was a top secret, special access program operated by the CIA.

Titanium skin

Because the aircraft was designed to fly faster than 2,000 mph, friction with the surrounding atmosphere would heat up the fuselage to a point that would melt a conventional airframe. The plane was therefore made of titanium, a metal that was able to withstand high temperatures while also being lighter than steel.

Using titanium presented other problems, however. First, a whole new set of tools -- also made of titanium -- had to be fabricated, because regular steel ones shattered the brittle titanium on contact. Second, sourcing the metal itself proved tricky. "The USSR was, at the time, the greatest supplier of titanium in the world. The US government had to purchase a lot of that, probably using bogus companies," said Merlin.

The initial aircraft were flown completely unpainted, showing a silver titanium skin. They were first painted black in 1964, after the realization that black paint -- which efficiently absorbs and emits heat -- would help lower the temperature of the entire airframe. The "Blackbird" was born.

Same plane, different names

The A-12 was soon evolved into a variant that was designed as an interceptor -- a type of fighter aircraft -- rather than a surveillance plane. Effectively, this meant adding air-to-air missiles and a second cockpit, for a crew member to operate the necessary radar equipment. This new plane, which looked identical to the A-12 except for the nose, was called the YF-12.

While the A-12 remained top secret, the existence of the YF-12 was revealed by President Lyndon Johnson in 1964, and three of them were built and operated by the US Air Force. A third variant was produced around this time, called the M-21, which had a pylon on its back for mounting and launching one of the first unmanned drones. Two were built, but the program was halted in 1966 after a drone collided with its mothership, killing one of the pilots.

The final derivative of the A-12, with a twin cockpit and larger fuel capacity, was called the SR-71 -- for "Strategic Reconnaissance" -- and first flew on Dec. 22, 1964. This is the version that would go on to perform intelligence missions for the US Air Force for over 30 years, and a total of 32 were built, bringing the final tally for the Blackbird family to 50.

Stealth before stealth

The fuselage of the SR-71 included some of the very first composite materials ever used in an aircraft, which made the plane harder to spot for enemy radar. "It was essentially stealthy before the word stealth was even used," said Merlin.

Flying at a higher altitude than anti-aircraft fire could reach, faster than a missile, and barely visible to radar, the Blackbird could enter hostile airspace practically undisturbed. "The idea was that by the time the enemy detected it and fired their missile, it was already on its way out," Merlin explained. "But this was before we had real time data links, so they were taking pictures on film and bringing the film back to base to be processed and studied."

As a result, no Blackbird was ever shot down by enemy fire. However, its reliability was an issue, and 12 out of 32 were lost to accidents. It was also a complicated plane to operate and fly. "It took an army of people to prepare the aircraft. A Blackbird operational mission essentially had a countdown, like a space mission did, because there was so much preparation involved in both getting the crew ready and the vehicle ready, an unbelievable amount of effort and manpower," said Merlin.

The pilots also had to suit up in a special way, due to the extreme conditions found at high altitude. "They basically wore a space suit, the same sort of thing that you would later see space shuttle crews wearing," said Merlin. "The cockpit also got very hot when flying at high speeds, so much that pilots used to warm up their meal on long missions by pressing it against the glass."

No Blackbirds were ever flown over Soviet airspace -- something the US government stopped doing entirely after the 1960 incident -- but they still played an important role in the Cold War, and performed missions in other critical theaters such as the Middle East, Vietnam and North Korea.

In 1976, the SR-71 set the records it still holds: flying at a sustained altitude of 85,069 feet, and reaching a top speed of 2,193.2 miles per hour, or Mach 3.3. The program was halted in 1990 -- with a brief revival in the mid-1990s -- once technologies like spy satellites and UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles or drones) had become more feasible and offered instant access to surveillance data.

The SR-71 was last flown by NASA in 1999, which used two of the aircraft for high-speed and high-altitude aeronautical research. Since then, the surviving Blackbirds have all found their way into museums. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

For photographer Landon Nordeman , finding beauty in the everyday is a full-time job. So, it's no surprise that his hometown of New York provides an endless source of creative and personal inspiration.

"I love people and I love just seeing out on the street a gesture, a flash of color, the way someone's leaning against a bus stop or an umbrella opening and passing by you," he said. "Just these little daily life moments that happen in New York, that somehow I just am forever intoxicated by."

Over the course of his career, Nordeman -- a regular contributor to the New York Times, Time and Vanity Fair -- has shot A-list celebrities at the Met Gala, fashion insiders at New York Fashion Week, and NBA draft hopefuls at the Barclays Center. But he insists that inspiration can be found in even the city's most hectic and accessible areas too -- tourists be damned.

"When you're in midtown you just see all of New York walk by, so I think that's the best spot to people-watch," he said.

"If I'm in Midtown, if I'm taking pictures, then I will stay and find a corner that has light or something, some sort of element that just I'm drawn to, and then I just want to stay there and kind of watch this parade come through."

Amid the glistening waves and youthful grins in Jeff Divine's photos of 1970s surfers, there's something conspicuously absent from the sun-drenched scenes: logos.

This was a time before sponsorship and mainstream attention turned the sport into a lucrative global industry. And the American photographer, a long-time picture editor at two of the scene's bibles, Surfer magazine and Surfer's Journal, was on hand to capture the hedonistic lifestyles and DIY approach of what he dubs the "pre-commercial" era.

"It was a time before we were branded -- before the outdoor lifestyle industry clothing brands started giving us free gear," he said in a phone interview from his home in California. "If you look at the photos, there are no backpacks, sunglasses, hats, watches or any of that stuff that's really common now.

"The '70s was a time when the general audience and society -- like your parents, grandparents, or even your brother -- just didn't understand what you were doing. You'd go home and you couldn't describe it."

This is why, despite having documented the sport extensively for five decades, Divine chose the 1970s as the subject of his new book . In it, he pays homage to the California and Hawaii scenes that he was actively involved in, bringing together more than 130 images from his vast archive.

Some of the collection's most striking photos capture the graceful stillness of surfers hurtling down huge, sculptural waves. The pictures often feature small details that only surfing aficionados will appreciate -- renowned surfing champions, technical moves or "guys who were our heroes doing maneuvers they were famous for," as Divine put it.

But the athleticism on display is evident to all -- and it is reflective of the sport's evolution during this period. The decade's (often garage-made) surfboards were shorter and lighter, which opened up new possibilities for the sport, according to the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist William Finnegan, who contributed an essay to Divine's book.

"Suddenly," Finnegan wrote, "people were turning twice as hard, going twice as fast, and, most transformingly, pulling into heaving barrels that had been unrideable, off-limits, the stuff of idle fantasy until yesterday."

It was also a time when Divine began taking his craft more seriously. Born in La Jolla, a seaside community in San Diego, he started out by shooting friends and fellow surfers in the mid 1960s. By the time he joined Surfer magazine in 1971 he was heading out onto the water with huge telephoto lenses designed for wildlife photography.

"When I first got my camera, I would surf first and then shoot photos," said Divine, who was recently honored with a plaque on the Surfing Walk of Fame at Huntington Beach. "Then, as I got more professional, by '70 or '71, I would shoot and then surf. By the 1990s and 2000s I just shot."

Insider's perspective

Being a surfer offered Divine obvious advantages, such as recognizing wave patterns and simply "knowing what the ocean was doing." But the photographer's insider status proved especially valuable as he set about documenting the culture -- or subculture -- surrounding the sport.

Photos featured in the book are intended to "reflect the characters and the people, rather than just men on waves," he said. As such, they depict surfers and their friends hanging out, skateboarding, watching waves crash into the beach and loading gear into their cars. In one shot, an unidentified man poses for the camera as he fans out huge bricks of hash, acquired via what Divine described as "surfer smuggler guys."

Being part of the very camaraderie that he hoped to capture gave the photographer "an edge," he said.

"I was one of them, and surfers can tell whether you're one of them or not. Outside photographers ... would come into the sport and visit over a week and come back with a whole different take from what someone like me might do. They knew me and trusted me -- it was bit like hanging out with a rock 'n' roll band.

"Everybody wanted to see a picture of themselves on the waves, so they put me on a pedestal because they knew I might get a photo of them and, if they were lucky, they might get in the magazine. It was like being what, in the modern day, you might call an 'influencer.'"

The photos will undoubtedly drip with nostalgia for those who lived through the era, though Divine takes a documentarian's approach to his work. Surfing's subsequent commercialization may have attracted what he reluctantly called "wannabes" who were "attracted to the romance of the sport," but the photographer still has plenty of praise for the state of modern surfing.

He described the sport's inclusion in this summer's Olympics Games in Tokyo as an "incredible thing" that may inspire a new generation of athletes. And amid the declining sales experienced by many of the world's big surf brands (labels like Quicksilver and Billabong have reported sinking profits in recent years), there appears to be something of a return to the values of old, he said.

Indeed, looking back more than 40 years later, Divine said he sees connections between the '70s surfers and today's -- and he doesn't just mean the tousled haircuts and beards that wouldn't look entirely out of place in 2020s California.

"I think it's so interesting how a lot of young guys now look the same as we looked then," he said, pointing to clothing choices in particular. "The commercial aspect of everything now has made young people want to wear something unique, which is like in the '70s, when you wore something from your travels.

"(Big brands) try and give you that look of being an athlete rebel outdoorsman, but it's commercial, and I think people are now seeking out more unique, boutique-y or 'found' things." <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

Mark Neville began shooting semi-staged portraits in the French region of Brittany in a funk at Britain's divisive Brexit referendum. But he emerged somewhere unexpected: a vision of 'ecotopia'.

"This idea of ecotopia underpins all the images -- this kind of search for happiness or utopia, through a relationship with the land and food, and animals -- and suggests that this is the way forward, basically," he explained, at the Photographers' Gallery in London.

The British photographer began shooting the series of portraits of local Breton farmers on the day of Britain's decision to leave the European Union, in response to his own feeling of disappointment at the political turn toward border-building. In the next three years, for his project "Parade," he encountered farmers and football fans, Breton dancers and baton twirlers, nuns and dog breeders.

In search of an ideal society, he found a horse-whisperer for abused steeds and a former abattoir worker who has assembled a Noah's ark of abandoned pets and livestock.

Shooting all his subjects in a semi-documentary format, often placing real characters in carefully staged situations, Neville teases out the Bretons' complex, unconventional relationships with animals, as well as strong sense of community with one another. Although he said there is a "naivety" in the idea that living closer with animals can be an answer to complex problems of social identity, he hoped to suggest, poetically and often playfully, that it represented a step in one right direction.

"You wouldn't normally see a pig on the bonnet of a car, for example," he said of his stylized images. "But the photos are kind of visual metaphors for the relationships between people and animals."

Neville is one of four photographers shortlisted for the Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize , whose work is on exhibition at the Photographers Gallery until June 7. The winner of the $39,000 (£30,000) prize, whose past awardees include Susan Meiselas and Juergen Teller, will be announced on May 14.

This year's contestants represent the great breadth of art photography, explained curator Anna Dannemann. She groups two of the shortlisted artists, Mohamed Bourouissa and Clare Strand, for their shared focus on how images represent the subjects or instead fail to communicate reality.

Algerian-born Bourouissa draws on art historical influences and mediated low-res phone snaps to show how social conflict marks the suburbs of Paris, while Strand's conceptual experiments create blocky images reminiscent of early dial-up internet graphics.

"The Blue Sky Project" by Anton Kusters also shares something with Bourouissa: a concern for trauma and grief. He took 1,078 Polaroid images of the a blue sky, shot at the location of every known concentration camp run by the Nazi Party between 1933 and 1945, arranged as a sombre monument on a large plinth in the exhibition.

Neville's own work has consistently straddled the line between documentary and art, creating a perceptible "contradiction" or "tension" in the images between something real and arranged, he explained.

Pointing to his picture of a baton twirler in front of a back of hunting dogs (see top image), he explains that it took three days to pose satisfactorily, with all the subjects -- human and non-human -- looking down the lens. "There is a tension that comes from knowing this is a very special, specific moment that I've managed to capture," he said.

Neville has often focused on working class communities in England and Scotland, including his acclaimed "Port Glasgow Book Project," in which he spent a year as artist-in-residence documenting the declining shipbuilding community in the town of Port Glasgow in 2004. He also pent two months British soldiers in Helmand Province, Afghanistan, for his 'The Helmand Work' (2010-2011).

The photographer had been in the small town of Guingamp in the rugged Northwest region of France when the shock result of the Brexit referendum was announced.

Although Brittany is part of continental France, it is sometimes called "Little Britain" (in contrast to Great Britain), for its historical connections to the people of the UK. For one, the area was named for after settlers who had left the British Isles in large numbers from around 450 AD, while the language of Breton is related to Cornish and Welsh. There, Neville discovered a "mirror" of his home country, he said.

There are dystopian aspects present in the work, too. Like other communities Neville has spotlighted, the region has been hit hard by economic decline and the industrialization of farming in the 21st century, with fewer Breton today employed in traditional small-scale farms and fisheries. He says that the photos are a way to show the inhabitants' "search for community and identity, and... how people realise or manifest their sense of who they are."

Brittany appears as an in-between place, which can swing as easily toward bucolic utopia as post-industrial dystopia. But in searching for a better society, Neville did find some hope. He tells the story of one subject, Alain, an ethical pig farmer, who lives with his three sons.

"It's just a small, ecological, ethical farm," he explained. "As soon I arrived it felt like home to me, it felt like a kind of paradise. He's got a warmth, and he really cares about the animals."

Asked what sets his farm apart from the industrialized norm, Alain said: "When I go into my land, and the pigs hear my voice, they recognize it as me and not someone else. You don't get that with an industrial farm... there's no sense of intimacy or relationship."

"A rapport between you and the animal, you know, that makes a difference, both in lives of the animals and the lives of the breeders," Neville concludes.

"It's quite simple and sounds naive to say, but it's true." <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
(CNN) — Texan newlyweds Jay and Carmen Martinez went straight from celebrating their beachside wedding to embarking on a globe-trotting honeymoon cruise across the South Pacific on board the Norwegian Jewel.

Ahead of the February 28 departure date in Australia, the couple had worried about the spread of coronavirus but didn't have the option to cancel the 23-day trip they'd booked two years earlier.

Now they are among thousands of passengers still at sea aboard more than 30 oceangoing cruise ships, some still hunting for a port that will accept them amid a global shutdown of the cruise industry and mounting fears of infection.

The Norwegian Jewel is believed to be heading for Hawaii, but there's no official word on its final destination and the ship has already been turned away from several ports.

"We had hesitations," Jay Martinez tells CNN Travel about their preboarding apprehension. The couple looked into amending their plans but were told they were locked in.

"Up until the day that we left, that was not an option," says Jay, "And with us having so much money invested into our honeymoon, we had no other choice but to board the ship."

The couple feared their itinerary might be curtailed, but they never expected that they'd end up stranded at sea, their ship scrambling for a place to dock.

They're not the only ones.

As coronavirus outbreaks afflicted numerous ships on at sea, the Cruise Lines International Association, or CLIA, made the decision on March 13 to suspend operations from US ports of call for 30 days.

CLIA encompasses 38 cruise companies, making up more than 95% of global cruise capacity -- a total of 277 ships.

"A handful of ships -- about 14% of the total CLIA fleet -- are currently at sea completing their journeys," the organization said in a statement to CNN. "Our members are focused on bringing these ships safely back to port as soon as they can."

Among the 30 or so still at sea, Norwegian Jewel is heading toward Honolulu, Hawaii, but no one's quite sure whether it'll be allowed to dock there.

Right from the outset, it was clear some ports were closed and some plans would have to be changed, says Jay Martinez.

The situation escalated dramatically about a week ago when CLIA recalled its ships, and French Polynesia turned the Norwegian Jewel away.

At first, the ship planned to head to Fiji instead and disembark there, but this plan was abandoned en route when the island country said the cruise liner would not be accepted. New Zealand followed suit.

The ship was subsequently allowed to refuel in American Samoa. "And that is when we started our long journey to Hawaii," says Jay.

Cruise operator Norwegian has yet to give official confirmation of the ship's final destination. In response to a query from CNN, a spokesperson confirmed that a plan to dock in New Zealand had been scrapped. "We will share an update as it becomes available," they said.

On board, Jay says guests have been riding waves of emotion -- relief when hearing of an imminent destination followed by disappointment when the plans were abandoned.

So far everyone on board the Norwegian Jewel is well, with no cases of coronavirus or quarantined passengers.

Still, Jay says guests are concerned and highly anxious, with tensions rising as the ship's trajectory became increasingly uncertain.

Everyone's aware, he says, that there's a real possibility that this could continue for days or weeks.

There are worries about medication running out, the health of friends, families and livelihoods back home.

Pacific princess

On the other side of the Pacific ocean, 76-year-old Ron Ernst has been playing a waiting game on board the Pacific Princess, a 338-cabin cruise liner with capacity for 670 guests.

Ron and his wife, Susie, boarded the ship on January 20 in Los Angeles. The retired Californian couple have enjoyed more than 25 cruises, including three round-the-world voyages.

They left US shores ready for another global adventure, embarking on their 111-day cruise odyssey barely aware of the mounting coronavirus threat.

"I am sure we had heard about some virus in China, but we had no concerns," says Ron.

It was toward the end of February that they became aware the virus might impact their itinerary.

The ship skipped calls at the Indonesian island of Bali, Singapore and the Thai resort of Phuket. Passengers were also banned from exiting the ship in Sri Lanka.

Like the Norwegian Jewel, the Pacific Princess is healthy -- with no cases of coronavirus -- but has still been riding a tide of uncertainty.

"The second night after Sri Lanka, the captain made the shocking announcement that, in view of the developing and quickly changing conditions, the cruise would terminate in Fremantle/Perth," says Ron. "We quickly realized that things were getting serious."

The ship made an 180-degree turn in the middle of the night, and began the 18 day sail back to Australia.

It finally arrived Saturday morning local time.

"Life on the ship continued with great food, entertainment and lots of socializing," says Ron.

Ron Ernst, stranded cruise ship passenger “We were healthy and comfortable as long we are in our safe cocoon. Not everyone is looking forward to getting back to the world.”

"The crew is absolutely fantastic. Their future is completely uncertain, but they are not letting it show. Princess has done an amazing job especially considering these unprecedented conditions."

Asked about the status of the vessel and those on board, Princess Cruises directed CNN to an online statement confirming the final destination and offering a helpline for friends and family.

On board the Pacific Princess, Ron Ernst says passenger moods fluctuated. It was mostly fear of the unknown that concerned them.

In fact, some were dreading returning to a reality that's become far from "normal."

"We were healthy and comfortable as long we are in our safe cocoon," says Ron. "Not everyone is looking forward to getting back to the world."

Also on board the Pacific Princess was CJ Hayden, 63, an author and business coach based in San Francisco.

Hayden, traveling with partner Dave Herninko, told CNN earlier this week that she just hopes to get home ASAP, in case further travel restrictions are put into place.

"Our biggest concern now is whether we can still get home to North America before airports, cities, or even borders are closed," she said. "The ship can't go any faster."

There were 547 passengers on board, and 448 are American. Princess Cruises says it has made flight arrangements for each passenger, and paid for air fare.

Anyone unable to fly because of medical reasons will stay on the ship as it sails on to Los Angeles.

Australia had previously announced it was closing its ports to cruise ship passengers. Hayden says Pacific Princess passengers have been granted permission to disembark on the understanding they head to the airport right away.

Those not booked on flights on March 21 will stay on board until their flight is ready to depart the next day.

"Almost all the passengers are seniors, with many in their 70s and 80s, and quite a few with disabilities," said Hayden earlier in the week.

"Some folks are bearing up well; others are freaking out," she said.

Like Ron, Hayden said "uncertainty" was the hardest thing to deal with.

Staying connected

On board the Norwegian Jewel, Jay, who works in public affairs, is trying to keep busy by remote-working from the ocean.

Carmen, who works in disease prevention, isn't able to telework. As some of the younger and more tech-savvy guests, both are trying to aid older passengers.

"[We are] helping out, getting in touch with family members that are having trouble connecting via internet or phone with those that are on this ship," says Jay.

He praises crew members also stuck on board and unsure of the future, highlighting their "phenomenal job of cleanliness and sanitary efforts" -- and their consistent generosity and understanding.

"There's a lot of frustrated people, and it's quite unfortunate that they get the brunt of the effects of what the corporate cruise line's shortcomings are, because they've just done a great job," says Jay.

Uncertain times

Right now, those on board the Norwegian Jewel are crossing their fingers that they'll be allowed to disembark in Hawaii on Sunday, but Jay says they have received no clear information about how they'll be getting home from the island.

"That uncertainty and that unknown and ambiguity of what our fate is going to be I think is the hardest thing to stomach," he says.

Much of the travel industry has been hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic -- hoteliers are laying off workers, airlines are appealing for government bailouts and cruise ships are hitting the headlines for all the wrong reasons.

So would Jay and Carmen Martinez ever get on board a cruise again?

Jay's diplomatic -- no one quite knows what the travel landscape is going to look like in six months or a year, he says. Plus, he hopes the cruise lines will put in new practices to deal with situations like this one.

"I wouldn't say that it has ruled it out for us in the future," he considers. "I think it's a discussion we're going to have to have when we arrive home and the dust has settled throughout all of this.

"So much will be dependent on how this continues to unfold and what will be the cruise line's response after their 30 day pause, in relation to this outbreak."

And despite being stuck at sea and unsure of when they'll see dry land again, there have been joyous moments on board.

After all, Jay and Carmen have been celebrating their honeymoon. Thursday was their one month anniversary.

"This has been a cruise and a vacation and a honeymoon like no other, and for great reasons and for terrible reasons," says Jay.

Jay Martinez, stranded cruise ship passenger “This has been a cruise and a vacation and a honeymoon like no other, and for great reasons and for terrible reasons.”

They're enjoying the on-board camaraderie, everyone's come together both despite, and because of, the difficult circumstances.

"We're very much bonded together, I think that we find solace in one another by finding humor in our situation, and conveying concerns from our various countries and sharing that news," says Jay.

CJ Hayden shares similar stories from the Pacific Princess.

"Some of us have been helping each other learn new skills," she said. "Two volunteers have been helping me and others learn watercolor painting. Another passenger has been teaching my husband how to use the gym equipment. We've taught several folks how to play chickenfoot dominoes."

The memory that will stick with her, she says, is when the ship stopped in Sri Lanka to refuel.

"On the pier next to the ship were soldiers with guns and dogs, and workers unloading supplies wearing masks and gloves. At 10 a.m., the passenger chorus gathered on the pool deck and belted out 'Put on a Happy Face.' "

Jay says he's proud of the way passengers and crew have collaborated in the face of uncertainty.

"It's a beautiful thing, because I feel at times our world is very separated," he continues.

"It's great to feel like we can take a stance in this pandemic as a global initiative, and I think that we have our own little minicommunity that represents just that -- that we are looking our for one another. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
(CNN) — Coastlines are one of the most alluring of our planet's geographical features.

The clash of land and water is often mesmerizing, as are the plants, animals and human activities that flourish along a shore.

In classic novella "Heart of Darkness," seafaring author Joseph Conrad wrote that all coasts are shrouded in mystery, with an invitation to "come and find out" what they have to offer.

Here are 16 of the world's best coastline destinations , scattered across six continents and three oceans:

Cinque Terre, Italy

This rugged Italian shore inspired Dante's vision of Purgatory in his poem "Divine Comedy," but to modern visitors, the Cinque Terre is absolute heaven.

Protected within the confines of a national park, as well as a UNESCO World Heritage site, it's made up of a cluster of five coastal villages that really do seem lost in time.

The villages are linked by the famous Sentiero Azzurro, as well as other hiking trails that lead to secluded beaches.

Turquoise Coast, Turkey

Known as Lycia in ancient times, the big bend along Turkey's southwest shore is one of the lesser known gems of the Mediterranean Sea which flaunts many attractive coastlines.

Its bays really are turquoise, especially otherworldly lagoon Ölüdeniz, or "Dead Sea," near the amazingly photogenic Fethiye.

Sailing is a great way to discover the coast's many secluded bays and coves.

Big Sur, California

A coast that inspired works by Hunter S. Thompson, Jack Kerouac and Henry Miller, photographer Ansel Adams and even the Beach Boys must have something special, and Big Sur doesn't disappoint.

The vertiginous drive along Highway One connects legendary Hearst Castle with redwood groves, rustic chic hotels, cliff-edge restaurants, and those cute little sea otters at Point Lobos.

Antrim Coast, Northern Ireland

Long before popular TV series "Games of Thrones" was filmed here, the Antrim Coast was renowned for its stark, natural beauty.

The Giant's Causeway, an estimated 40,000 basalt columns created by an ancient volcanic eruption, is one of its stand out sites.

Visitors can hike the shore on the Causeway Coast Way, a 51-kilometer trail that includes the vertigo-inducing Carrick-a-Rede Rope Bridge.

Stretching from Goa to India's southern tip, the fabled Malabar Coast was once renowned in for its fabulous riches and wealthy seaports.

Nowadays travelers come here to relax on its sun-splashed beaches, cruise the coastal canals in luxury houseboats and slumber in the posh oceanfront resorts of Goa and Kerala.

Skeleton Coast, Namibia

Bleak, harsh and beautiful. Ship wrecks and animal bones litter the shoreline, where crashing waves meet brutal desert. The forbidding nature of Namibia's Skeleton Coast has left it one of the most pristine shorelines in the world.

Where else can you see lion stalking sea lions and elephants thundering down a beach but this super-secluded stretch of the Namibian coast north of Swakopmund?

Scattered with shipwrecks, sand dunes and remote fishing camps, the Skeleton Coast is also great for safaris of the surfing or wildlife kind.

Garden Route, South Africa

This stretch of coast takes its name from the unique fynbos vegetation that blankets many of its hills, vales and headlands.

While there are certainly swank beach resorts here, the main allure is unencumbered nature and outdoor adventure, marine mammal encounters, wilderness hikes like the Otter Trail, and the world's highest commercial bungee jump, measuring 216 meters.

Great Ocean Road, Australia

Australia's most eclectic coast stretches 243 kilometers between Torquay and Warrnambool along the southern shore of the state of Victoria.

Although it's most renowned for spectacular sea stacks the Twelve Apostles, this stretch of waterfront also boasts the lauded Bells Beach of surfing fame, wildlife rich Cape Otway, and historic sites like Flagstaff Hill.

Nā Pali Coast, Hawaii

Na Pali Coast is literally translated as "the cliffs." Shutterstock

It's no wonder Steven Spielberg chose Kauai's north shore to shoot the original "Jurassic Park" movie, Nā Pali just feels primeval.

With cliffs rising up thousands of feet that plunge straight into the ocean, secluded jungle waterfalls and beaches that can only be reached by hiking for half a day, it's a stunning sight to behold.

Kayak camping the coast is the best way to experience its edgy, end of the Earth vibe.

Andaman Coast, Thailand, Malaysia and Myanmar

While the Andaman Coast is most closely associated with Thailand's southwest shore, it actually elongates all the way from southern Myanmar to northern Malaysia.

Along the way are popular beach resorts like Phuket, Krabi and Langkawi, legendary dive spots like the Similan Islands, as well as under the radar treasures such as Myanmar's Mergui Archipelago.

Beagle Channel, Chile and Argentina

The Beagle Channel separates Argentina's Tierra del Fuego archipelago from remote Chilean islands. Shutterstock

Named after the Royal Navy ship that took Charles Darwin on his global voyage of discovery, the channel runs around 240 kilometers along the south side of Tierra del Fuego island.

Flanked by snow-capped peaks, thick sub-polar forest, and tidewater glaciers tumbling down from the Cordillera Darwin ice field, the shore largely uninhabited shore offers a glimpse of planet Earth the way it must have been before mankind.

Planet ramblers looking for adventure might consider spending time with these 10 living ambassadors from the past, including a bird with millions of flight miles, a rose that survived an aerial bombing, a tree linked to Buddha, green globules in the Andes and massive poriferans in Antarctica.

These and other amazing paleo-pilgrimages await the dedicated traveler

WILD BIRD: About 68 years

Wisdom , the world's oldest confirmed bird in the wild, turned at least 68 this year. Since she was banded in 1956, the Laysan albatross has logged more than three million flight miles, six times the distance to the moon and back!

In between oceanic migrations, the frequent flier returns in the autumn to the Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge to raise her chicks. She's survived a tsunami and hatched an estimated 30 to 40 eggs on the island.

With persistence and permits, one can see Wisdom and her fellow Phoebastria immutabilis on their Pacific paradise. Midway Atoll is located on the far northern end of the Hawaiian archipelago.

LAND ANIMAL: About 187 years

Jonathan , the most beloved resident of St. Helena, a tiny island in the South Atlantic, was born about 1832, five years before the coronation of Queen Victoria. Since then, the giant tortoise has lived through 39 US presidents.

He never met the other notable to live in the island, Napoleon, as the French emperor died in exile there in 1821. The gentle reptilian giant originated from the Seychelles in the Indian Ocean, but made the move to the Atlantic as a gift to the then-governor of St. Helena in 1882.

Since then he's roamed about the governor's grand island estate, where he enjoys the company of three other giant tortoises and frequent human guests.

BLOOMING ROSE: Approximately 1,200 years

Celebrated as the Thousand Year Rose, a towering rose bush in Germany is thought to have been established by King Louis the Pious in 815.

The bush grows alongside a Catholic cathedral dedicated to St. Mary in Hildesheim, a beautiful medieval village noted for its ancient churches.

Besides beauty and age, the plant exhibits remarkable fortitude. Allied bombing during World War II left the cathedral in ruins, but the rose, a Rosa canina, also known as the dog rose, somehow survived, flourished and now grows more than 30 feet high next to the apse of the restored church.

Visit anytime, but late May and early June are the best times to see the delicate pink blossoms.

PLANTED TREE: Approximately 2,300 years

The fig tree under which Siddhartha Gautama experienced enlightenment in India is long gone, but a cutting from it, carried by a royal devotee to Sri Lanka around 250 BCE, give or take a few decades, has grown into one of the most revered trees in the Buddhist world, and the oldest known tree with a planting recorded in history.

Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi, Ficus religiosa, has welcomed the religious, the curious and the nefarious in the centuries since.

H.G. Wells marveled at it. Elephants damaged it. Tamil separatists besieged it.

Today, pilgrims of all kinds pay homage, especially on full moon (poya) days, to the tree, which sits among elaborate gardens, canals, golden fences, religious stupas and younger Bodhi trees in the Mahamewna Gardens in Anuradhapura, Sri Lanka.

WORKING TREE: Approximately 2,500 years

Whether planted by man or nature, between 2,000 and 3,000 years ago, before the rise of Classical Greece, a seed sprouted on the Mediterranean island of Crete that to this day produces a yearly crop of olives.

But the monumental tree in the village of Vouves does more than make drupe fruit. It and other ancient Olea europaea nearby, similar in wizened age and appearance, attract artists, religious leaders, Olympians and heads of state, inspired by their strikingly gnarly trunks and limbs.

The Vouves tree now features a museum highlighting the traditional olive harvesting techniques of Crete, once the seat of the Minoan civilization, which flourished in antiquity from its olive oil trade.

WILD HERB: Approximately 3,000 years

These eye-catching blobs are Andean shrubs that may date back thousands of years. Shutterstock

The Yareta or llareta, bright green blobs that resemble moss-covered boulders, are actually flowering shrubs perfectly designed to withstand the high-altitude conditions of the Andes Mountains in Peru, Bolivia, northern Chile and western Argentina.

Wind, freezing temperatures and drought prove no match for Azorella compacta, a wild, inedible relative of parsley and fennel, which slowly and methodically ekes out an existence, growing as little as one meter a century.

Because of their slow growth rate, the largest shrubs are thought to be approximately 3,000 years old.

Given their density -- a shrub can easily support the weight of a human -- Yareta have been used like peat as a traditional fuel. Fortunately, South American governments have rallied to protect the endangered species.

SINGLE TREE: Approximately 5,000 years

Methuselah, a bristlecone pine in the White Mountains of California, stands at the ripe old age of about 5,000, making it the oldest known non-cloned organism on Earth.

Named for an Old Testament figure who lived 969 years, the Pinus longaeva's exact whereabouts remain a closely guarded scientific secret, but you can wander by its ancient peers and perhaps the very tree itself on a 4.5-mile hiking loop through the Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest within Inyo National Forest

Whether one stumbles upon the most ancient one or not, this grove of grizzled knotted pines -- many older than the Egyptian pyramids, clinging to sheer arid mountains that jut from the desert floor -- inspires no less.

LIVING ANIMAL: Approximately 15,000 years

The volcano sponges of Antarctica, Anoxycalyx joubini, are whitish blobs that resemble giant beer barrels or miniature volcanoes. They pepper the chilly waters around McMurdo Sound and their estimated age is based on the sheer size of the sponges, which only grow a tiny bit each year.

They thrive in depths from 50 to 500 feet, sentinels of a deep realm they share with other strange creatures, like tiny crustaceans and wiggly worms that live inside the sponges, and packs of pin-cushioned sea stars that dine on the two-meter-tall monsters.

Only the most dedicated scuba divers can explore this realm. Thanks to extreme ocean outfitters such as Polar Trec , they can -- enjoying, after drilling through the ice, some of the best underwater visibility in the world.

LAND FOREST: Approximately 80,000 years

The Trembling Giant of Utah consists of almost 50,000 quaking aspen trees, but the entire grove of Populus tremuloides is genetically identical and shares a single root system, making it technically a single organism.

This clonal colony of an individual male is also known as Pando, Latin for "I Spread Out," which it sure does, covering more than 100 acres.

The leaves of one quaking aspen make quite a flutter in the gentlest of wind. Listen to the tuneful effect times tens of thousands as you overnight, right in Pando's heart, in a campground in Fishlake National Forest.

SEA FOREST: Approximately 200,000 years

A sprawling sea grass meadow ten miles long near Spain ranks as the oldest known single organism on Earth, according to geneticists.

Posidonia oceanica, known as Neptune's grass, is endemic to the Mediterranean Sea. But a patch near the island of Formentera, self-cloned like Pando, stands out for its age, estimated at 200,000 years. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
(CNN) — Simply finding the Seven Summits -- the highest mountains on each continent -- is a tall order.

Let alone measuring them all to within a few frustratingly ever-evolving feet, naming them after rock star 19th-century British colonial land surveyors and Polish-Lithuanian generals -- and, get this, risking limb and life-savings to climb them all because, well, they're there.

Stark, scary, seductive, forever inscrutable, the Seven Summits and countless viable alternative peaks to "conquer" say far more about humans (basically that we have far too much time on our hands) than we ever will about them.

But that shouldn't stop us from tirelessly rambling on about these majestic monsters or traveling there.

MOUNT EVEREST

Elevation: 29,035 feet

Location: Nepal/Tibet border

There's no customs booth on the summit of Mount Everest -- the highest mountain on Earth -- where a frontier straddles Nepal and Tibet. So what's with all the crazy lines on this cramped, gale-plumed, oxygen-starved peak?

The ultimate magnet for big ticket bucket-listers vying for a shot at standing on top of the world during a narrow climbing window in late spring, Everest is all business these days. The fabled peak attracts more puffy-suited high-fivers than ever to its increasingly doable but dicey slopes -- and about as many divergent references, depending on your angle.

Nepalis call their famous hill Sagarmatha ("Sky Head"), Tibetans know it as Chomolungma ("Mother of the World"), while geologists lump Everest (named after legendary 19th-century British land surveyor George Everest) in the youth category.

Roughly 50 million years old -- a toddler in big mountain time -- it's the largest fold of Indian and Eurasian tectonic plates in the Himalayan range, with plenty of growing room left (about a quarter inch a year).

Ever since it was first scaled in 1953, Everest has remained a crowning achievement among snowballing legions of climbers. Recently, the mythical mountain has also been described as the "world's highest garbage dump" (of abandoned climbing detritus) and a "zoo" of Death Zone queues waiting for summit selfies at airplane altitudes.

During an especially busy and lethal 2019 climbing season, the mountain has claimed at least 11 lives.

Reach for the top: Climbers typically reserve at least 45 days (including pre-ascent preparations, a long tromp to base camp, and crucial acclimatization periods on the mountain before an average four-to-five-day summit push) and an ante of anywhere from $40,000 to over $100,000 for a spot on a commercial expedition.

From the Nepal side, the Southeast Ridge is by far the most popular passage to the summit, among nearly 20 other climbing routes at present. Last year, over 800 climbers and support guides reached the top -- a new record.

Marvel from below: Barring a long bus ride, the most chilling part of the suggested two-week roundtrip trek to Everest Base Camp is a quick flight from Kathmandu to a harrowingly short mountain airstrip in Lukla. From there, the 40-mile ascent past mountain villages, Buddhist monasteries and bell-clanging yak traffic to the 17,600-foot-high base of the world's highest peak is often shortlisted as one of the world's greatest hikes. And a great place to smile and turn around.

Alternative alp (for Himalayan realists): 20,285-foot Imja Tse (commonly known as Island Peak) holds the unofficial distinction of being one of the most climbable "trekking peaks" (basic mountaineering skills and gear still necessary) in the Everest region -- with bonus views of neighboring giants Mounts Lhotse, Nuptse, Makalu and Ama Dablam.

MOUNT DENALI

Elevation: 20,310 feet

Location: South Central Alaska

North America's highest peak (formerly named Mount McKinley) may max out at an elevation barely above Himalayan low camps, but never mind all that. Few bits of tectonically bent granite are as impossibly enormous as Mount Denali, which rears nearly three-and-a-half vertical miles up above its relatively low 2,000-foot starting point.

From base to summit, that's over a mile taller than Everest.

The crown of the 600-mile-long Alaska Range is big enough to create its own weather patterns. Like, for example, 150 mph winds and -93°F on an especially brutal day.

Scientists say Mount Denali is still on the rise -- at a steady-ish rate of about half a millimeter per year. So check back in a mere four million years from now and the ultimate Bob Ross mountain may be about a mile higher.

The vast majority of climbers attempt to reach the summit via the popular West Buttress route, which can see as many as 600 people on it at any given time during peak season between late May and early June.

Marvel from below: Boarding a tour or transit bus during temperate summer months along 92-mile Denali Park Road provides incredible views of the famed peak and numerous wildlife photo ops in a six-million-acre park and preserve inhabited by nearly 40 different mammals and 172 recorded bird species.

AFRICA

MOUNT KILIMANJARO

Elevation: 19,340 feet

Location: Northern Tanzania

Even for a lone cone as spectacular as this jumbo geological marvel plunked in the East African plains, how does even the coolest-looking, -sounding, -residing mountain retain its rightful mystique once the annual climber rate surpasses the 50,000 mark?

Probably just by being Kilimanjaro -- the world's tallest freestanding peak, a dormant (but still simmering) volcano, and a not-so-microcosmic world unto itself.

Meandering through numerous ecological zones (tropical rain forest, heath, moorland, alpine desert, etc.) from savanna to snowcapped summit, hardy climbers here might be fooled into thinking they're tromping across half the planet. But that would be too easy.

Reach for the top: A non-technical "walk up" climb with several established routes to choose from, Kilimanjaro is far too susceptible to being minimized as a multi-day hike. Reality check: Less than 30% of climbers manage to complete the entire journey on the most popular 5-day Marangu "Coca-Cola" Route plan, according to local guide service Ultimate Kilimanjaro.

A better bet: Losing the hasty crowds and adding a few extra days of acclimation on one of the longer, slower, undulating routes to combat altitude sickness -- the main reason hikers bow out here.

Dry season (late June to October) is the preferable time to tackle Kilimanjaro, with September being the prime climbing month. Permits are essential to enter the park, and all climbers must use a guide and porters.

Marvel from below: Summit fever aside, don't forget where you are -- in prime African safari territory. Making time to see the Big Five and other amazing creatures in nearby Serengeti National Park and Ngorongoro Crater is a rivaling high point during any Kilimanjaro climbing expedition. Many guide services can build these visits into the itinerary.

Alternative alp (for road-less-taken types): Mount Kenya (17,057 feet). Far from the Kili crowds and less than 100 miles from Nairobi, Africa's almost-famous, second-highest mountain occupies its own national park -- frequented by savvy African peak baggers seeking a quieter, cheaper and reputedly an even more picturesque climbing experience.

EUROPE

MOUNT ELBRUS

Elevation: 18,510 feet

Location: Southwest Russia

Perched on the European side of the Caucasus Mountains -- which forms a continental divide with Asia -- twin-peaked Mount Elbrus edges out Mont Blanc (see below) and all those glitzier alps to the west by at least a half-mile of perma-frosted vertical, making it Europe's (and Russia's) highest hill.

There's literal mythical status on the dormant volcanic slopes of Elbrus -- where Zeus reportedly chained Prometheus's arms as punishment for stealing fire from the gods.

Those flames have long been extinguished on an enormous icy mound adorned with over twenty glaciers, deep verdant valleys and raging rivers below. Plus a steady circuit of adventure-seekers arriving with crampons, skis and hiking poles.

Reach for the top: During summer climbing season, the most popular passage to the summit of Elbrus' west peak (the higher of the two) is along the Standard Route via the mountain's south face, where a cable car can take climbers as high as 12,500 feet.

From here, the ascent often takes between six to nine hours (descent about three hours) during a long and strenuous but technically undemanding climb that's best done with an experienced guide and after at least a week of proper altitude acclimation.

Currently, a US Travel Advisory warning is in effect for the North Caucasus region, which includes Mount Elbrus.

Marvel from below: Elbrus is merely the high point of picturesque Prielbrusye National Park, which draws hikers and nature lovers of all levels to one of southern Russia's magnificent wilderness zones -- filled with trails, mineral springs, ski runs and visitor amenities in the alpine village of Terskol.

SOUTH AMERICA

MOUNT ACONCAGUA

Elevation: 22,841 feet

Location: Western Argentina

The highest mountain in the Western and Southern Hemispheres with a base camp that claims to be the second busiest in the world after Everest, Mount Aconcagua was in an earlier life an active volcano on the edge of a shallow dinosaur-era sea.

Today, this subducted Argentinean peak's glaciated slopes are an arid 150 miles from the nearest ocean, a stone's throw from the Chilean border, and the prize ambition of every semi-sensible summit seeker leaving K2 for some other lifetime.

Reach for the top: Most climbers opt for the non-technical northern "Normal Route" during peak climbing season from mid-December to the end of January.

Cheaper and easier to scale than its distant Himalayan cousins, Aconcagua might be perilously confused for an "Everyone's Everest." According to Mountain IQ, at least 60% of the mountain's estimated 4,000 annual climbers do not reach the summit -- and many are completely unprepared for the challenge.

Aconcagua reputedly holds South America's highest mountaineering fatality rate (about three deaths per year) plus numerous casualties of hypoxia and frostbite due to brutal weather at unforgiving elevations.

Marvel from below: Entry permits for Aconcagua Provincial Park must be obtained in person from the tourism office in Mendoza, 70 miles east of the mountain. The good news: this puts you smack in the middle of prime Argentina wine country.

Alternative alp (for Andean overachievers): Ojos del Salado (22,615 feet). About 400 miles north of Mount Aconcagua, perched on the same jagged spine dividing Argentina and Chile, is the continent's second tallest peak. A popular non-technical climbing site on the edge of the Atacama Desert, Ojos del Salado also holds the distinction of being the world's highest active strato-volcano and (fun fact) home to the highest point ever reached by a 4x4 vehicle. Last big eruption: about 1,300 years ago.

AUSTRALIA

MOUNT KOSCIUSZKO

Elevation: 7,310 feet

Location: Southeastern New South Wales

If there's one comfortingly moderate exception to Australia's status as a "land of extremes," it would be in the Seven Summits category, home to the lowest and most user-friendly of the bunch.

Tucked in its namesake national park in the Snowy Mountains, Mount Kosciuszko manages to be both the highest point in mainland Australia and a pleasant walkabout in nice weather with a convenient chairlift to help move things along.

A revised Seven Summits list has technically replaced this mountain with a higher Oceanic peak (see "alternative alp" below) sharing the same broader continent. But Kosciuszko remains a classic version favorite for moderates and diehard fans of the 19th-century Polish-Lithuanian military leader for which the peak is oddly named.

Reach for the top: From the ski resort village of Thredbo, start with a scenic warm-up ride on the Kosciuszko Express Chairlift to the Kosciuszko Walk trailhead, where a four-mile hike past herbfields, alpine lakes and gradual inclines leads to the summit. Expect company during antipodean summers, when the mountain receives about 100,000 visitors.

Marvel from below: Mountain drives in Australia don't get more dramatic than the winding roads of Snowy Mountains country. For close-ups of the highest peak, Alpine Way Drive provides a sufficiently steep and narrow 67-mile road trip between Thredbo and Khancoban in Kosciuszko National Park.

Alternative alp (for continental plate nerds): If Australia and Oceania (as purists point out) are joined at the plate, then the Seven Summits title instead goes to the crest of Puncak Jaya (16,024 feet) -- a.k.a. Carstensz Pyramid -- hiding in Indonesia's Papua province. A rare glaciated peak in the tropics, it's also considered one of most technically tough mountains to climb on this list.

MOUNT VINSON

Elevation: 16,050 feet

Location: 600 miles from the South Pole

The final frontier as far as Seven Summits go, Mount Vinson is about as close as a hump of ice-caked rock can get to a galaxy far, far away.

Simply recognizing the continent's highest point -- tucked on a plateau of peaks in West Antarctica's Sentinel Range of the Ellsworth Mountains -- was a milestone.

Vinson was the last of the Seven Summits to be successfully climbed (in 1966), and it would take years before another expedition made it back to repeat the feat. Over 1,200 climbers have since made it to the top, led by a handful of specialized commercial guides.

There's a joke that simply getting to this mountain (four-hour cargo plane commute from Punta Arenas, Chile, to Union Glacier snow camp with a 50-minute Twin Otter hop to Vinson Base Camp) is the hardest part of the climb. But it's just a joke.

LOS ANGELES — The NBA went on hiatus March 11, and if there was any concern the league acted too hastily, the rapid spread of the coronavirus throughout several teams (Los Angeles Lakers, Boston Celtics, Brooklyn Nets, Utah Jazz, Detroit Pistons, etc.) relieved any doubt.

Very quickly, the NBA went from full attendance to considering games without spectators to fully shut down. It was undoubtedly a difficult decision but one that wasn't difficult to execute. No more games.

The real challenge will be starting back up. When will that be a serious consideration, and what will that look like?

"I honestly don't know," NBA Commissioner Adam Silver told Rachel Nichols on SportsCenter on Wednesday, answering a similar line of questions.

"Should we consider restarting without fans, and what would that mean?" Silver asked rhetorically. "Because presumably, if you had a group of players and staff around them and you could test them and you can follow some protocol, doctors, health officials may say, 'It's safe to play.'"

That's not going to happen with new player diagnoses popping up just about daily. But assuming the league can keep its players in isolation—quarantined until doctors and health experts agree the health threat has passed enough for play to resume—how would the NBA proceed?

Getting to 50

David Dow/Getty Images

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has a recommendation that any events with 50 or more people should be canceled for the next couple of months. If that limit holds, can the league even put on a game?

Start with up to 17 players on each team, including those on two-way contracts who won't be returning to the G League this season. That's 34, but keep out all but the 13 active players per team. That's down to 26, but it's over halfway there.

Coaching staffs range in size, but would limiting the bench to one head coach and one assistant be a reasonable stipulation?

Add in three referees, the clock and scoreboard operators, the NBA's liaison to the instant replay center, the statisticians who track game data live, a trainer, physical therapists, a team doctor, camera operators and a skeleton crew of team security, floor-mopper, broadcast crew, some level of media coverage and so on. How many people are needed on hand just to get an NBA arena up and running?

The number 50 isn't realistic.

Alternatives

L.E. Baskow/Associated Press

That remains the case even if games are played at practice facilities. Players are easy enough to quarantine. So too are the officials. But everyone else on the list? It's not enough to have squads that have passed the intensive scrutiny to resume play.

One transmission, even to a non-player, and the league shuts down again.

Multiply the risk to 29 arenas (with the Los Angeles Clippers and Lakers sharing Staples Center) and the travel involved. Can the league isolate and quarantine that much personnel?

Then there's the logistical nightmare of rescheduling games. How many regular-season games are cut, understanding there's a financial component to each one eliminated? Playing without a crowd will cost hundreds of millions of dollars, and that's being optimistic. The league is staring down at least $1 billion in losses as things stand.

To alleviate the complications, perhaps a neutral site would make more sense for the league. Bring the entire NBA to Las Vegas, where they have T-Mobile Arena and the nearby facilities at UNLV's Thomas & Mack Center. The city certainly has the hotel capacity with casinos currently closed.

A central, controlled environment might give the NBA a practical shot at finishing the season. The next issue would be getting the broadcast partners on board, including the local and national networks. Given the dearth of live entertainment and no need to wait for fans to get off work to fill stadiums, perhaps games could be played throughout the day, one after another, until the schedule is complete.

It's not the only way the league can make it work, but it would minimize travel and the number of game operations staff that would need to be isolated. There's no easy solution to what the world is facing, and the NBA is no different.

The When

Frank Franklin II/Associated Press

The "when" is still a mystery. Technically, all player contracts either roll over to the 2020-21 season or expire outright as of July. Under the circumstances, the NBA and the players union are likely to work together to find a solution, even if that means pushing that rollover date to the fall.

Whatever income is lost by the league, roughly 50 percent will be passed on to the players. That loss will undoubtedly impact next year's salary cap, which was last projected by the NBA to reach $115 million.

That number will drop for next season and subsequent years, although the league and union can agree to some form of cap smoothing to make the decline less of a shock to the system. The NBPA rejected cap smoothing before the 2016-17 season, when the league's current television deal kicked in. It refused to accept a lower salary cap than the system dictated, with a subsequent balloon payment to the union after the season.

Instead, the cap jumped $24 million, enabling the Golden State Warriors to sign Kevin Durant but also leading to many oversized, regrettable contracts (like Luol Deng, Joakim Noah, Ian Mahinmi, Timofey Mozgov, etc.). Looking ahead, the union may need an about-face on cap smoothing when confronted with what could be a $95 million cap next season, or even $75 million in the worst circumstance.

Pushing back the conclusion of the current campaign could delay the start of next season. Perhaps now is the time, given the league and union will need to negotiate their way out of the existing crisis, for more fundamental change to the league.

In early March, Atlanta Hawks CEO Steve Koonin suggested at the MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference in Boston that the league push its entire schedule back, operating from December to August instead of October to June. Koonin said the NBA doesn't need to be competing with the NFL and should instead take advantage of the available time over the summer for games.

That would probably mean pushing the draft back, along with free agency and summer league. The panel was discussing theoretical fixes to the NBA, but Koonin's idea may be happening organically by circumstance. The global pandemic may usher in sweeping reform to the NBA schedule—certainly in the short term, and maybe it spurs on fundamental change.

The priority before the league can return to some version of normal is health. The finances pale in comparison to player, team and public safety. When it's right to do so, the NBA and NBPA (along with the broadcast partners and, to an extent, the arena operators) need to work in concert to make it happen.

Silver wasn't prepared to say what form the resolution will take. How could he? The world is searching for answers on much broader issues. But the NBA's return would be a welcome distraction for the millions cooped up in their homes.

Hopefully there's a pathway that opens for the embattled 2019-20 season to be completed in some form or another.

The Philadelphia 76ers' and New Jersey Devils' at-will employees will have their salaries temporarily reduced by up to 20 percent beginning April 15 because of the coronavirus pandemic, according to the New York Times' Marc Stein.

Stein added the mandate applies to employees whose salaries exceed $50,000 and will continue through the end of June. Employees on contract, including the front office and coaching staffs, will be asked to participate in the cut but will not be required to do so, per Stein.

The Sixers and Devils are both owned by Harris Blitzer Sports & Entertainment.

The NBA and NHL seasons have been suspended in order to limit the spread of COVID-19, with no firm timetable as to when they'll return.

ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported NBA owners and executives "are bracing for the possibility of mid-to-late June as a best-case scenario." The NHL is on hold until at least mid-May after the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended holding no events with 50 or more people for at least eight weeks.

Such a prolonged hiatus is bound to have a significant impact on the bottom line for major sports leagues.

Players and teams throughout the NBA and NHL have stepped up to provide funds for full and part-time workers who are out of a job for the time being.

NHL deputy commissioner Bill Daly confirmed to ESPN's Greg Wyshynski that hockey players will receive the entirety of their 2019-20 salaries.

Their counterparts in the NBA don't yet have the same certainty regarding their finances. According to Wojnarowski, the NBA will pay players their usual salaries April 1 "but left open the possibility of recouping future salaries for canceled games on April 15."

Between the fallout from Daryl Morey's tweet supporting protestors in Hong Kong and the ongoing pandemic, the Washington Post's Ben Golliver noted the NBA could be more than $1 billion in lost revenue when all is said and done. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

NFL physicals will be put on hold until the health crisis related to the coronavirus has passed, per Ian Rapoport of NFL Network:

This will prevent teams from getting medical clearances on either free agents or potential draft picks.

Ben Volin of the Boston Globe predicted this could mean "no more signings or trades for awhile."

The new NFL league year began on March 18, but players were not allowed to take their customary free-agency visits due to travel concerns surrounding COVID-19. As a result, many free-agent signings haven't become official because players can't get physicals from team doctors.

Tom Brady found a doctor in New York to perform his physical instead of Tampa Bay Buccaneers staff, per Jeff Darlington of ESPN.

With team doctors no longer working with NFL players for the duration of the pandemic, other players could have to wait before deals are finalized.

ESPN's Jeremy Fowler reported teams have already been putting provisions in contracts under which players would have to forfeit signing-bonus money for a failed physical down the line.

In the meantime, NFL doctors will apparently be used to help combat the coronavirus, which has continued to spread worldwide. According to the World Health Organization, there have been over 31,000 cases in the United States as of Monday, leading to more than 400 deaths. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

Widely expected to break a 16-year playoff drought after a long rebuild and a significant influx of talent, the Cleveland Browns face-planted with another losing season in 2019.

But to Cleveland's credit, it has done everything right this offseason.

That started with firing 2019 head coach Freddie Kitchens, who was in over his head during a 6-10 debut campaign in which he failed to rein in an undisciplined team. And it continued when Cleveland started fresh with a highly promising, exciting yet accomplished head coach-general manager combo in Kevin Stefanski and Andrew Berry.

But the Browns made the brunt of this year's progress in the opening days of free agency last week, when Berry made a series of smart decisions that bolstered an already stacked roster and maximized Cleveland's chances of experiencing success in 2020.

Everyone knows success in this day and age usually starts at quarterback. When the Browns first showed signs of life down the stretch in 2018, rookie No. 1 overall pick Baker Mayfield was at his best. And when it all hit the fan in 2019, Mayfield experienced a sophomore slump. But it didn't help that the offense often left him out to dry.

The two most significant moves of Cleveland's offseason were made to give the signal-caller more support in his critical third year.

Mayfield faced more pressure in his second campaign than he did in his first (23 pressures, up from 15, per PFF), and he struggled under duress, but incoming offensive tackle Jack Conklin should help with that. Tackles Greg Robinson and Chris Hubbard struggled while taking a combined 19 penalties and surrendering a combined 10 sacks in 2019, according to PFF. Ideally, both won't be needed in 2020 (serious legal issues could keep Robinson away regardless).

Tony Dejak/Associated Press

Conklin gets you halfway there. PFF's top-ranked 20-something-year-old offensive lineman in this year's free-agent class was that outlet's sixth-highest-graded right tackle last season despite a torn ACL in January 2018. He's already been an All-Pro, and he should continue to take off at age 25.

Cleveland can turn to the draft—where it holds the No. 10 overall pick and three Day 2 selections—to fill its other starting tackle spot.

On the same day they shored up Mayfield's offensive line with Conklin, the Browns also gave the 24-year-old QB a top-notch security blanket in tight end Austin Hooper. Just 25, the 2016 Atlanta Falcons third-round pick is coming off back-to-back Pro Bowl seasons and a 2019 in which he set career highs with 75 catches, 787 yards and six touchdowns despite missing three games because of a sprained MCL.

Mayfield loves his tight ends. He relied heavily on Mark Andrews at Oklahoma, and David Njoku was one of his favorite targets when he got hot as a rookie. But that position let him down last year. Njoku missed all but four games because of a wrist injury and was virtually a non-factor, and neither Demetrius Harris nor Ricky Seals-Jones were reliable.

Those three dropped a combined eight passes, while Hooper dropped just one on 38 more targets in Atlanta.

Mayfield already had Odell Beckham Jr., Jarvis Landry, Nick Chubb and Kareem Hunt at his disposal, but his offensive line remained a liability in 2019, and he rarely had a tight end to bail him out. That should change, which could make it extremely difficult to stop one of the league's most skilled offenses.

The Browns will likely miss departed linebacker Joe Schobert, who was the heart and soul of the defense and a tackle machine. But Cleveland deftly prioritized support for Mayfield over an off-ball linebacker. Schobert and oft-injured 'backer Christian Kirksey, who signed with Jacksonville and Green Bay, respectively, were always far less likely to make a difference in 2020 than Conklin and Hooper.

John Bazemore/Associated Press

And because of that sensible approach, the Browns enter the second wave of free agency leading the league with $48.4 million in salary-cap space, according to Spotrac. Berry has room to re-sign whoever he chooses when the price is right, and he could dip his toe back into the free-agency pool as deals become cheaper in the weeks to come.

A trade for disgruntled Washington Redskins star left tackle Trent Williams would be icing on the cake, and the venerable Jason Peters remains available as well.

Of course, the Browns could still use help on defense, where they ranked 22nd in DVOA (defense-adjusted value over average) at Football Outsiders and surrendered 24.6 points per game last season. Myles Garrett's reinstatement from suspension helps, though, and the front office quietly got tremendous value from defensive tackle Andrew Billings, cornerback Kevin Johnson and safety Karl Joseph, signing each to one-year deals worth $3.5 million or less.

Billings and Joseph were listed as two of the best under-the-radar free agents by yours truly just before the start of the new league year. The former is a 6'1", 328-pound run-stuffer who takes up a ton of space and has plenty of tread on his tires, while the latter is a tremendous run defender in the box who still has room to grow as a 2016 first-round pick.

All three (including Johnson) have yet to turn 28.

Put it all together, and it's increasingly difficult to find weak spots on Cleveland's roster. Combine that reality with a new atmosphere, and it looks like the Browns got it right.

It might have just taken a year longer than expected.

Brooklyn Nets' star point guard Kyrie Irving announced Monday that he is donating $323,000 to Feeding America, with Lineage Logistics matching up to $200,000 in donations as well, amidst the coronavirus pandemic.

He is also partnering with City Harvest and donating 250,000 meals across the New York area. Irving announced he is creating the Share A Meal campaign in partnership with those organizations "to help marginalized communities get the food sources they require."

If the donation number feels oddly specific, B/R's Howard Beck broke down the reason for the $323,000 figure:

Irving, 28, was averaging 27.4 points, 6.4 assists, 5.2 rebounds and 1.4 steals in 20 games this season, shooting 47.8 percent from the field and 39.4 percent from three. A shoulder injury cost him the first 26 games of the season, however, while surgery for a right shoulder impingement ended his season prematurely in early March.

The entire NBA went on a minimum 30-day hiatus due to the coronavirus pandemic later in the month, and a number of players, owners and coaches have given back to local communities and stadium personnel out of work during the outbreak.

The Golden State Warriors, for instance, combined to create a $1 million to disaster relief fund for Chase Center employees.

"The men and women who work our games at Chase Center are critical in providing an incredible game-night experience for our fans," superstar guard Steph Curry said. "As players, we wanted to do something along with our ownership and coaches to help ease the pain during this time."

Many other teams have taken similar approaches during the stoppage, while athletes like Irving and others have contributed to food banks, charities or provided money for first responders and medical workers. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

Both NBA players and owners are focused on concluding the 2019-20 season when action eventually resumes across the league, according to ESPN's Ramona Shelburne.

Shelburne said Monday on Outside The Lines that "no matter what, they want to salvage the season—if that's in July, if that's in August, if that's in September, so be it."

The NBA suspended games indefinitely March 11 because of the coronavirus pandemic.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention effectively ruled out a return before mid-May when it recommended an eight-week halt to events with more than 50 people to limit the spread of COVID-19.

ESPN's Adrian Wojnarowski reported NBA owners "are bracing for the possibility of mid-to-late June as a best-case scenario" for when the 2019-20 season might resume. According to Wojnarowski, one plan discussed by the NBA included games in empty arenas, with the playoffs extending into August.

Even assuming the date didn't get pushed back further, the lengthy hiatus would create a domino effect for 2020-21.

The New York Times' Marc Stein reported some around the NBA are lobbying for a schedule where free agency would start in September and the regular season would tip off on Christmas Day: "It is hardly unanimous, but there is a faction eager to turn the delay forced upon the league by the coronavirus outbreak into an unexpected testing ground."

Stein noted that league calendar would put the NBA in less direct competition with the NFL and college football and instead match it up against MLB for the bulk of the year.

Especially if the stakeholders are invested in completing this season in order to properly crown a champion, the NBA could experience long-term logistical repercussions from the ongoing situation. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
(CNN) A 5-year-old student at an elementary school in Vista, California, collected enough money to pay off the negative lunch balances of 123 students at her school.

Katelynn Hardee, a kindergartner at Breeze Hill Elementary School, overheard a parent say she was having difficulty paying for an after school program.

"She started asking me a lot of questions and I just tried to explain to her that sometimes people aren't as fortunate and that we need to try to be kind and give when we can," Karina Hardee, Katelynn's mom, told CNN.

So Katelynn decided to set up a stand on December 8, spending her Sunday selling hot cocoa, cider, and cookies. Katelynn and her mom donated the $80 collected, which went towards paying off the negative lunch balances of over 100 students at her elementary school.

By doing this, the youngster hopes that other students "can have a snack and lunch. If they don't, their tummies grumble," Katelynn said, according to her mom.

(CNN) A man saved his neighbor's dog after its leash got caught in an elevator door on Monday and their apartment security cameras captured the rescue.

Johnny Mathis, 27, was coming home from work in Houston, Texas and had just parked his car in his apartment complex's underground garage. Mathis lives on the ground floor of his community so he took the elevator up to his floor. As soon as he got off, a woman and her dog were trying to get on.

"When she got on, I was looking at the dog, because it was a cute dog," Mathis told CNN. "I noticed the leash was kinda long but I didn't think it wasn't going to make it on the elevator or anything."

In the 39-second clip Mathis posted on Twitter , you see him leaving the elevator but quickly coming back to pick up the Pomeranian once he saw the owner was gone and it was still stuck there alone.

Mathis said he yelled back to her, "hey your dog!" when he noticed the Pomeranian didn't make the elevator.

(CNN) It's something that girls and young women in western countries can't imagine: missing school, even dropping out, because of their periods. Yet as many as half the girls in rural parts of Ethiopia miss school for reasons related to their periods -- and that can have a devastating effect on their education and the rest of their lives.

Freweini Mebrahtu has dedicated her life to keeping girls in school by designing a reusable menstrual pad and trying to end the cultural stigma around the issue -- and because of her work, she has been named the 2019 CNN Hero of the Year

"I don't even know what to say," Mebrahtu said when receiving the award. "I am so humbled and grateful for CNN ... this is for all the girls and women everywhere. Dignity for all."

Online voters selected Mebrahtu as the 2019 CNN Hero of the Year award from among the Top 10 CNN Heroes finalists

Mebrahtu -- who is from Ethiopia and studied chemical engineering in the US -- designed and patented a reusable menstrual pad in 2005. She and her team produce 750,000 reusable pads a year at her factory in Ethiopia. Nearly 800,000 girls and women have benefited from her work.

The Fastest Way To Pay Off $10,000 In Credit Card Debt

This site may be compensated through a credit card issuer partnership.

What's the best way to pay down a credit card balance as quickly as possible, while paying the least in interest, and without hurting your credit? What follows is a powerful method recommended by the most astute personal finance experts to achieve exactly those objectives. It's extremely effective, completely legal, and leverages programs created by credit card issuers to your advantage. Follow these steps and start to become credit card debt-free.

Step 1: Use A Powerful Tool To Immediately Stop Paying Interest On Your Balance

Think of someone carrying a credit card balance like a patient who enters an emergency room bleeding badly. The first thing a doctor will do is stop the bleeding. It's no different when attacking a credit card balance; the first thing you do is stop the interest charges.

There's a simple way to do this, and it's brilliance is that it actually uses the banks' marketing offers to your advantage: find a card offering a long "0% intro APR balance transfer" promotional offer, and transfer your balance to it. These are cards which offer new customers a long period of time (often as much as 18 months) during which the card charges no interest on all balances transferred to it. We constantly track all the cards in the marketplace in order to find the ones currently offering the longest 0% intro periods.

If you need more motivation, just think of this: on a $10,000 balance, $150 of a $200 monthly payment would get vacuumed up by interest charges.* That leaves only $50 of your $200 that actually reduces your balance, the rest vanishing into bank pockets. That's just brutal. Use our reviews to find a card which offers the longest possible no-interest period while charging low, or even no fees. Moving your balances to the card you choose will stop the bleeding, allowing you to move on to step two.

Step 2: Power Through Your Balance During The 0% Period.

Once you've transferred your balances and put a stop to the interest charges, it's time to capitalize on the interest-free period to really break free of the debt. The best part of this is how simple it is: just keep making the payments you used to make when you had to pay big interest payments, except now 100% of your payment will go to reduce your balance.

Going back to the $10,000 example above. (just be aware that we're using the $10,000 number as an example to demonstrate how the process works. You may be approved to transfer an amount greater or less than $10,000). If you transferred that balance onto a card which offers 15 months of 0% intro APR with no transfer fee, and maintained the same $200 monthly payment, you can see how much faster you'll be reducing your balance in the chart below.

As you can see, without using the 0% card, the same $200 monthly payments barely make any headway. It's like swimming upstream, or walking while taking a step back for every two steps forward. That's no way to swim or walk, and attempting to pay off your cards while paying high card interest rates is no way to manage your finances. Move your balances onto one of the cards below, stop getting crushed by interest, and start making real progress toward getting rid of your card debt.

Piero Cruciatti/AFP/Getty Images Giuseppe Corbari holds Sunday Mass in front of photographs sent in by his congregation members in Giussano, Italy, on March 22. Many religious services are being streamed online so that people can worship while still maintaining their distance from others.

The novel coronavirus is spreading across the world.

The illness was first reported in late December in Wuhan, a city of 11 million people in central China's Hubei province. It has now found a foothold on every continent except for Antarctica, and many countries have declared a national emergency.

The World Health Organization declared it to be a pandemic, the first since the H1N1 flu in 2009.

Coronavirus symptoms can look like a common cold or flu. But for those with a weaker immune system, the virus could cause more serious illnesses like pneumonia or bronchitis. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

(CNN) From elephants to lions and orcas to seals, most female mammals outlive males -- just like their human counterparts, new research suggests.

Researchers looked at 101 species of wild mammals living in 134 different locations and found that females lived longer than males in 60% of cases, What was particularly surprising to the researchers was just how much longer they lived -- on average they had an 18.6% longer life span.

By contrast, in humans, females live 7.8% longer than males, according to the study , which published Monday in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy Of Sciences.

While there were quite a few mammals where the males of the species lived longer -- such as horses and some species of bat and rabbit -- the magnitude was much lower, said Jean-François Lemaître, a researcher at the French National Centre for Scientific Research and an author of the study.

Lemaître said the study was the widest reaching on the topic to date, although he said they were unable to include many species of small rodents. That's because there isn't much data on those animals in the wild.

Mark Lennihan/AP A man crosses the street in New York's Times Square on March 23.

The novel coronavirus is putting much of the world on hold.

To try to slow the spread of the virus, people are being asked to avoid crowds and limit their travel.

Organizations are doing their part to help.

Sports leagues are suspending their seasons. Museums, theme parks and other popular attractions are shutting down. Schools are closing, and companies are having people work from home. Religious communities are modifying their traditions.

(CNN) Archaeologists say they've found the long-lost capital of an ancient Maya kingdom near the border between Mexico and Guatemala.

The Sak Tz'i' kingdom was home to between 5,000 and 10,000 people in what is now Chiapas, Mexico, from about 750 BCE to 900 AD, Brandeis University associate professor of anthropology Charles Golden told CNN.

The kingdom wasn't particularly powerful and was surrounded by some of the superpowers of the day, Golden said. He said the Sak Tz'i' kingdom was frequently mentioned in inscriptions found in other cities.

"The reason we know about the kingdom from the inscriptions is because they get beat up by all these superpowers, their rulers are taken captive, they're fighting wars, but they're also negotiating alliances with those superpowers at the same time," he said.

The downtown area was about a third of a mile long and a quarter mile wide (600 meters by 400 meters) and had pyramids, a royal palace, a ball court and a number of houses.

(CNN) When will Americans get the money they need to weather the biggest domestic crisis since World War II? That is the big question after the Senate failed to agree on a mammoth $2 trillion stimulus plan last night . The rescue package was blocked by Democrats who said it prioritized corporate industry over American workers.

The Senate plans to vote again early this afternoon, as the fate of the American economy -- and millions of jobs -- hang in the balance. Rand Paul won't be there after he became the first senator to test positive for the virus . Some lawmakers are angry at the Kentucky Republican for not doing more to self-quarantine earlier, potentially exposing others. "This is a different ballgame now," one GOP senator told CNN.

With the rescue bill under threat, and US cases climbing, governors are pleading with President Donald Trump to use wartime powers that would push the private sector into increased production of badly needed masks, ventilators and other medical supplies, which states are currently having to compete over. Trump said yesterday he would activate the National Guard in three of the hardest-hit states -- New York, California, and Washington. New York, the epicenter of the crisis in the US, with nearly half of all national infections, now has a startling 5% of all global cases.

Over the weekend, as the global number of cases soared past 300,000, governments ramped up strict measures; India placed millions under lockdown , Germany restricted gatherings to two people, Spain enforced new travel bans , Italy requested US military support, and Australia urged citizens to avoid all "non-essential" movement. And the Olympics are under threat, with Canada and Australia refusing to send their athletes.

For those who are unconvinced of the risks, look to Hong Kong. Only a week ago, the city seemed like a model for how to contain the virus; now it's an example of what happens when you let your guard down too soon

WHAT'S IMPORTANT TODAY

Olympics edge toward postponement

After weeks of insisting that Tokyo 2020 would go ahead as planned in July despite the global pandemic, Tokyo's organizing committee admitted this morning that postponement of the Games was now "a realistic option."

The Games were dealt another blow earlier today, when Australia joined Canada in announcing that it would not be sending athletes to the Summer Olympics . Both countries are calling for the Games to be pushed back until 2021.

Australia's decision came hours after the International Olympic Committee's executive board said it was considering postponing -- but not canceling -- this Games, scheduled to begin on July 24.

Lockdowns not locked down enough

In Europe, which is now host to half of all cases worldwide, governments are struggling to make their citizens adhere to strict lockdown measures, as the pandemic widens.

Chancellor Angela Merkel has banned groups of more than two from gathering in Germany -- among the strictest rules enforced to combat the virus. It follows reports that young people in parts of the country were holding "corona parties." She is now in self-isolation after learning her doctor tested positive.

Italian mayors are deeply frustrated over people who are breaking lockdown measures, but fines and arrests don't seem to be deterring them. Spain is set to extend its state of emergency for another 15 days, as cases soar and it saw the highest daily number of deaths yesterday.

Yesterday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned Britons to behave more responsibly or face more draconian restrictions , after people flocked to parks to enjoy a sunny weekend. This morning in London, some Tube trains were packed as though it was business as usual.

As the sudden surge in cases in Hong Kong shows, quarantines and social distancing must continue well beyond the initial wave of cases, if another round of infections is to be avoided . Today, Hong Kong Chief Executive Carrie Lam announced that all non-residents would be barred from the territory, the latest addition to a raft of new measures intended to curb the spread of imported cases.

Economic uncertainty intensifies

A global recession, once unthinkable in 2020, is now a foregone conclusion and some experts warn that the pandemic could drag the world's economy into a depression, Charles Riley writes

On most people's minds is job security. Goldman Sachs predict a shocking 2.25 million Americans will have filed for their first week of unemployment benefits this week -- the highest level on record, Julia Horowitz reports . The investment bank thinks the US unemployment rate will shoot up from an all-time low of 3.5% to 9% "over the next couple of quarters." And fears of joblessness on this scale could jolt markets again.

TODAY'S TOP TIP

Are you craving carbs and sleeping badly while stuck at home? Here's how to cope, according to Sandee LaMotte

Keep a regular sleep schedule -- go to bed at the same time each night, and get up at the same time each day. That helps train your brain to expect sleep.

Get out of the house for at least 15 to 30 minutes a day. Daylight helps set your circadian rhythm, or body clock.

Even mild exercise, such as walking, improves sleep. But make sure any intense exercise isn't too close to bedtime.

Stop any caffeine intake by 3 p.m. This includes coffee, black or green tea, and sodas. Chamomile tea, however, is a good option before bed because the herb can help with relaxation.

Be sure the bedroom is dark and cool. Science tells us that we sleep better in cooler temperatures.

Q: Is going to the beach OK? What about hiking?

A: Many authorities and experts, in fact, recommend outdoor activity -- but with caution. There are, of course, several factors to consider and various limitations (by location or personal vulnerability level) in just how far outside you can venture. And in areas currently worst hit by spiking cases, most outdoor activity just isn't possible as authorities work to beat back the virus.

Lagos, Nigeria (CNN) Nigeria reported its first coronavirus-related death on Monday, the country's Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) said.

The patient was a 67-year-old man who came back to Nigeria in March after undergoing medical treatment in the UK, the NCDC said in a tweet.

He had multiple underlying health conditions including including cancer, diabetes and had been undergoing chemotherapy treatments, the statement from the agency said.

Two people, including an Italian who was the first case of coronavirus diagnosed in the country, have recovered and been discharged from the hospital, authorities said.

The country is locked in a race against time to control the spread of the novel coronavirus in Africa's most populous nation as cases have increased to 36 across six states as of Monday morning.

(CNN) In the summer of 2008, an elderly psychic who claimed she started receiving premonitions at age 5 published a book that contained an ominous prediction.

"In around 2020, a severe pneumonia-like illness will spread throughout the globe, attacking the lungs and the bronchial tubes and resisting all known treatments," it said. "Almost more baffling than the illness itself will be the fact that it will suddenly vanish as quickly as it arrived, attack again ten years later, and then disappear completely."

The prediction faded from public memory and the book's author, Sylvia Browne, died in 2013. But the coronavirus pandemic has brought new attention to Browne's book, "End of Days: Predictions and Prophecies About the End of the World." It's shot up to No. 2 on Amazon's nonfiction chart , and physical copies are now selling for hundreds of dollars.

Government and public health officials have issued all sorts of guidelines to help people protect themselves against the spread of Covid-19. But there's another contagion that experts seem helpless to stop: The plague of prophets warning that the coronavirus is a sign we're at the "end of days."

There is something about pandemics that cause panicked people to empty their minds along with supermarket shelves. Countless doomsday warnings like Browne's prediction are spreading online, blending coronavirus fears with everything from political paranoia about a "#oneworld gov controlled by the UN" to Australian wildfires and swarms of locusts in Africa.

What drives these doomsday 'prophets'

Many include wildly inaccurate readings of the Book of Revelation. Often these pandemic prophets end their predictions with sign-offs such as "IF YOU DON'T HAVE A BIBLE, BUY ONE!"

Maybe it's no wonder some people are stocking up on guns and ammo.

But some who study religion and prophecies for a living say it's time for these social media prophets and psychics to take a self-enforced quarantine. Doomsayers are harming peoples' spiritual and psychological health, they say.

They're also claiming knowledge that even the most revered figures in religion didn't dare assume. Whenever Ulrich Lehner, a Catholic theologian at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana, comes across a social media preacher warning that Covid-19 means the end of the world is near, he's tempted to tweet back this response: "Matthew 24:36."

Some people have been stockpiling food as the coronavirus outbreak spreads.

That's the passage when Jesus says about the end of the world: "But about that day or hour no one knows, not even the angels in heaven, nor the Son, but only the Father."

"Jesus himself said, 'You don't know the hour,' yet some self-appointed prophets today seem to know more than the angels around God's throne," Lehner says.

Lehner says some of the doomsday prophets may be driven by another sin: pride.

"Perhaps in these guys who create mass panic there is also a certain pride, a bloated self-confidence that 'I have some special insight,''' says Lehner, author of "God is Not Nice: Rejecting Pop Culture Theology and Discovering the God Worth Living For."

"If that's not devilish, I don't know what is."

But one man who linked Covid-19 to biblical scriptures says he wasn't trying to spread fear.

Elisha Jones, a youth director at a church in southeast Texas, tweeted a screen grab of a Facebook post that cited 2 Chronicles 7: 13-15 . That's where the Bible says God told Solomon, "When I shut up the heavens so that there is no rain, or command locusts to devour the land or send a plague among my people ... I will heal the land" if people "turn from their wicked ways."

A subway customer uses a tissue to protect her hand while holding onto a pole Thursday, March 19, in New York City.

Someone wrote a caption above the biblical passage that read: "Australian wildfires -- the rain was held back. Africa - locust plague. World pandemic -- Covid-19."

Jones told CNN he was trying to warn people that "Jesus said these things will happen" and that the Earth is undergoing "birthing pains before Jesus' second coming."

"I absolutely think it could be a direct sign of something God said would happen, or even a precursor for things to come," Jones says about Covid-19 and other world events.

There's a long history of bad doomsday predictions

Remember Y2K? How about the recent "Mayan Apocalypse?"

Some people pointed to the end of the Maya Long Count calendar, on December 21, 2012, to conclude it also meant the end of the world. They warned of giant tidal waves and that the Earth would collide with another planet. Sales of survival kits soared, and there were reports that a man in China built a modern-day Noah's ark

But such bad predictions aren't a modern phenomenon.

Some doomsdayers build underground bunkers. Ron Hubbard, CEO of Atlas Survival Bunkers, demonstrates how to manually pump air into a corrugated pipe bomb shelter.

Historians say many Christians in 17th-century Europe predicted the world would end in 1666 because the numbers "666" represented the mark of the Beast mentioned in the Bible's Book of Revelation. When the Great London Fire, which lasted four days, erupted that year, many saw it as a fulfillment of the prophecy.

Browne, the author and psychic, was consistently criticized for the inaccuracy of her prophecies when she was alive. There are numerous accounts that she made mistaken claims about crimes that increased the suffering of victims' families. She even predicted she'd die of old age at 88 -- she died at 77.

Even Browne's most famous prediction, about a mysterious respiratory illness in 2020, looks different in a critical light.

Snopes, the fact-checking website, said, "lobbing vague claims about likely events does not a prediction make," when examining Browne's prophecy. It rated her prediction as not true or false but as a "mixture" containing significant elements of both truth and falsehood.

"It's unclear whether Browne's 'prediction' was more of a lucky guess, considering the book was written after the SARS outbreak," Snopes said.

Many repeat myths about Revelation

If there was a prize for the most misunderstood source for bad predictions, it would go to the Book of Revelation. It may be the Bible's ultimate crossover -- no other book's imagery and language has so penetrated popular culture.

Even people who have never read the Bible are familiar with its references: The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, the Red Dragon, 666 and the seven bowls of plague.

Revelation is filled with such contagious imagery that one theologian who has studied its text calls it a "multimedia" book whose popular images operate like an infectious disease.

Empty shelves in a supermarket in London, Thursday, March 19, 2020.

"They break off from the larger text and circulate like little viruses in our culture that hook on to other things and that's when they really take off and spread," says Timothy Beal, author of "The Book of Revelation: A Biography."

Beal says many people quoting Revelation get the meaning and the symbolism wrong.

"Almost none of the people talking about Revelation have really sat down and read it," he says. Many people, for example, believe that the "Rapture" -- when it's believed that Jesus returns at the end of the age and all Christians, dead and alive, will rise up in the air to meet him -- is in Revelation.

Not true, says Beal.

There is no explicit mention of the Rapture in Revelation. There are references to the concept in scriptures like 1 Corinthians 15:52, which says, "...For the trumpet will sound, and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we will be changed."

But Beal says the Rapture theory actually originated in the 19th-century work of a theologian named John Nelson Darby.

A police officer checks the temperatures of passengers at a checkpoint in Manila, Philippines, on March 16, 2020.

How about the Antichrist? Isn't that in Revelation?

Nope, Beal says.

The writer of the first book of John in the New Testament warns of generic "Antichrists" who deny that Jesus is the messiah. But there is no figure like the central character in the film, "The Omen," a cunning son of Satan with the number 666 stenciled on his body.

So what about 666 -- isn't that in Revelation?

Yes, but it doesn't refer to Satan. Instead, theologians say the number references another incarnation of evil for the first Christians: Nero, the Roman emperor.

Jones, the Texas church youth director, cited Revelation 15:1-3, which warns about "seven angels with seven plagues."

"I don't think posting things of that nature is to spread fear, " Jones says. "My belief is God is coming soon and there will be things that were written that will take place, things that may seem a little scary, but I think it reaffirms what God said would happen."

Why invoking doomsday scenarios can be harmful

Invoking "end-times" biblical passages may actually bolster some people's faith by giving meaning to events that seem cruel and arbitrary.

But people who invoke the terrifying imagery of Revelation in connection with COVID-19 can do more than get scripture wrong. They can damage others' psychological health, Beal says.

"I had one student who was reading Revelation outside on the waterfront and she fell asleep and woke up in the middle of a thunderstorm. She had an absolute panic attack because she felt like she was in the book," says Beal, a religion professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio.

Doomsday predictions from the Bible can also lead to another danger -- doing nothing, Beal says. He believes people who are seized with panic over something like Covid-19 may ignore other chronic issues threatening humanity's survival, such as climate change.

Hundreds of people line up to enter a Costco store on March 14, 2020, in Novato, California.

"It can lead to a call to inaction," Beal says about misinterpretations of Revelation. "That is to say, people will say this is all happening because of God's plan and it's going to get worse before it gets better so there's nothing we can do about it because it's God's will."

But that probably won't stop people from invoking Revelation when a pandemic hits. For centuries it's been the go-to book for doomsday prophets warning about the spread of "end-times plagues" and bizarre weather patterns.

One scholar questioned whether the Book of Revelation predicted the coronavirus in a recent column for the Christian Post , concluding, "the final shaking will be far more intense than this."

Many Biblical scholars, though, say the book of Revelation is not really about the end of the world. Rather, it was about the end of the world of its author, a devout Jew and earlier follower of Jesus. He was struggling to understand how the Roman empire had stormed Jerusalem in 70 A.D. and burned down its great temple after quashing a Jewish revolt.

The destruction of the temple of Jerusalem was incomprehensible for some earlier followers of Jesus. They had expected Jesus to return "with power" and conquer Rome before inaugurating the new age. But Rome had conquered Jesus' homeland instead.

A volunteer wears a protective suit as he uses fumigation equipment to disinfect common areas of a local residential compound on March 5, 2020, in Beijing, China.

The book of Revelation was the author's way of reminding early Christians that God and justice would ultimately prevail, says Lehner, the Notre Dame theologian.

"The book of Revelation is not a book about predictions but a book of consolation," Lehner says.

Consolation is what people should spread on social media right now -- not doomsday predictions, he says. Lehner says that in recent days he's seen beautiful prayers and even humorous messages on social media that have lifted his spirits, and he urges people to reach out to those who may be isolated.

Doing so may not be as thrilling as sharing predictions of doom. But before you decide to get in touch with your inner Nostradamus, share a kind word rather than a doomsday prediction, he says.

You'll feel better in the end -- and so will many of us who'll need all the help we can get in the tough days ahead. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
(CNN) With all the school closures across the world, nursing homes have also followed suit.

For residents at Bryn Celyn Care Home in Wales, United Kingdom that means visits from loved ones are put on pause. The home has been on lockdown since March 12.

"Everyone in the home team and residents are worried about the virus," Michelle Williams​, general manager at Bryn Celyn Care, told CNN. "But we are staying positive and doing what we do every day, which is supporting our residents, and keeping it as normal as possible."

Williams said residents are filling their day with activities like cooking, quizzes, craft sessions and exercise classes.

Currently the residents and staff are all well and there are no coronavirus-related illness in the home, according to Williams. The staff is making sure that "stringent infection control measures" are in place so it stays that way.

(CNN) German Chancellor Angela Merkel will self-quarantine after coming into contact with a person who tested positive for coronavirus, her spokesperson said Sunday.

Steffen Seibert, the spokesperson, said a doctor gave her a vaccination on Friday, then tested positive for the virus shortly after. While in quarantine, Merkel will continuously be tested for coronavirus, he added.

Earlier Sunday, Germany implemented a "contact ban" to curb the spread of coronavirus, Merkel said.

In a press conference, she said Germany would toughen its measures and encourage residents to "reduce contact with people as much as possible."

"To that end, Germany will ban gatherings of more than two people," Merkel said. Exceptions, she later explained, include families and people living together.

(CNN) Spain plans to extend its state of emergency for another 15 days, Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez announced Sunday, as the number of Covid-19 deaths soars in the country.

Sanchez addressed citizens in a televised briefing on Sunday, after meeting with health and security officials.

He said he expected Parliament to approve his request to lengthen the order, which has been in place for over a week.

It comes with the country's death toll from the virus accelerating. The country's health ministry said on Sunday that another 394 had died in just the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of confirmed fatalities to 1,720.

But Fernando Simon, director of the Spanish Coordinating Centre for Health Alerts and Emergencies, sounded a note of cautious optimism Sunday.

(CNN) Here's some background information about the Abu Ghraib prisoner abuse scandal which took place during the Iraq war .

Facts

Abu Ghraib prison was a US Army detention center for captured Iraqis from 2003 to 2006. An investigation into the treatment of detainees at the prison was prompted by the discovery of graphic photos depicting guards abusing detainees in 2003.

The facility was located 20 miles west of Baghdad on 280 acres.

At the height of the scandal, the prison held as many as 3,800 detainees.

Most of the detainees lived in tents in the prison yards.

The abuses took place inside the prison in cell blocks 1A and 1B.

Eleven US soldiers were convicted of crimes relating to the Abu Ghraib scandal. Seven of those were from Maryland-based 372nd Military Police Company. A number of other service members were not charged but reprimanded.

(CNN) While the world collectively shelters in place to protect against coronavirus, medical professionals flock to the front lines to work long hours tending to a burgeoning number of infected people.

One of them is Dr. Nicola Sgarbi, 35, who unknowingly became part of a growing photo trend of health workers coping with this exponential rise in sick patients.

Italy has been indicative of the spike in infections. On Saturday, the country had more than 47,000 coronavirus cases and some 4,000 deaths from the disease. Sgarbi is a doctor in training who works in the ICU of the civil hospital of Baggiovara in Modena, Italy.

Almost everything about Sgarbi's shift on March 13 was part of his new normal since the outbreak: working 12 hours to treat Covid-19 patients while wearing protective equipment. But at about 8 p.m. that day, he stripped off his face mask and snapped a quick selfie, something he rarely does.

Dr. Nicola Sgarbi is one of countless medical professionals around world putting in extra hours to help people suffering from coronavirus.

"I mainly took the photo for two reasons. Firstly, to send it to my partner, to tell her that I had finished my shift at work and that I was on my way home, slightly bruised," Sgarbi told CNN over email. "Secondly, to show it to my 1-year-old daughter when she will have grown up. I will be telling her about this moment."

History

Some historians believe the April Fools' customs began in France, although no one knows for sure.

It may stem from a calendar change in 16th century France -- the moving of New Year's Day from April 1 to January 1 when the Gregorian calendar was adopted.

People who continued to celebrate New Year's Day on April 1st rather than the new date of January 1st were referred to as "April fools" and others played tricks on them.

Around the World

In France, April 1st is called "Poisson d'Avril."

French children fool their friends by taping a paper fish to their friends' backs.

When the "young fool" discovers this trick, the prankster yells "Poisson d'Avril!"

In Scotland, April Fools' lasts two days. Victims of pranks are called gowks (cuckoo birds). The second day is known as Taily Day, and pranks involving the backside are played. Supposedly, it is the origin of "kick me" signs.

In England and Canada, pranks are only played in the morning of April 1st.

"The world cannot afford the unthinkable consequences of a COVID-19 pandemic in Africa," he said in a statement

Africa has so far recorded more than 1,100 cases of the coronavirus according to the World Health Organization by Sunday, although the infection is occurring at a slower pace than the hardest-hit places, more resources are needed to curtail the spread of the disease on the continent.

Ma has also donated coronavirus prevention supplies to the United States, Italy, and other countries in Asia and Latin America.

"Now it is as if we were all living in the same forest on fire. As members of the global community, it will be irresponsible of us to sit on the fence, panic, ignore facts, or fail to act. We need to take action now," Ma said. <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
(CNN) Right now, almost 780 million people live without access to clean water, and more than 2.5 billion need improved sanitation. That's according to the World Health Organization. March 22 is World Water Day, an annual UN observance spotlighting something so basic -- and yet so scarce for so many. There are some simple things you can do at home that can help care for the global water supply.

Support organizations making an impact

Here are organizations you can support that are making a difference where water is insufficient around the world:

Water.org focuses on providing funding so communities can maintain access to clean water and sanitation. The nonprofit organization was founded by actor Matt Damon and engineer Gary White.

Keep water clean

It starts at home, and it's not just about the water coming out of the tap; it's also about the water sent down the drain or into the ground. Here are some ways to help keep water clean.

• Never flush expired or unwanted medicine down the toilet or drain

• Fix any leaks from cars and collect oil by putting liner on driveway

• Pick up after your pets to prevent waste entering drains, spreading bacteria

Conserve at home

Children from the remote Turkana tribe in Northern Kenya dig a hole in a river bed to retrieve water.

It's an easy concept to understand: Don't waste water. But just because it's simple doesn't mean people do it. Using water more efficiently in daily life can go a long way.

• Turn off faucets when not in use

• Shorten the length of showers

• Use low-flow toilets

• Water plants by hand rather than hose <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>

Hamamatsu (CNN) Sitting in an armchair next to his sister, in a cozy living room in the Japanese city of Hamamatsu, Iwao Hakamada looks like your average 83-year-old grandpa.

But in 2014, he became the world's longest-serving death row inmate, after spending nearly five decades in a tiny, solitary cell waiting for the hangman's call.

In 1966, the former professional boxer-turned-factory worker was accused of robbery, arson and the murder of his boss, his boss' wife and their two children. The family was found stabbed to death in their incinerated home in Shizuoka, central Japan.

Iwao initially admitted to all charges before changing his plea at trial. He was sentenced to death in a 2-1 decision by judges, despite repeatedly alleging that police had fabricated evidence and forced him to confess by beating and threatening him. The one dissenting judge stepped down from the bar six months later, demoralized by his inability to stop the sentencing.

A pair of blood-spattered, black trousers and his confession were the evidence against Iwao. The alleged motive ranged from a murder by request to theft.

victims' blood type. But in 2004, a DNA test revealed that blood on the clothing matched neither Iwao nor thevictims'blood type.

In 2014, the Shizuoka District Court ordered a retrial and freed Iwao as he awaited his day in court, on the grounds of his age and fragile mental state. But four years later, the Tokyo High Court scrapped the request for a retrial, for reasons it would not confirm to CNN.

That means Iwao could go back to prison and face the death penalty -- again.

His legal team has launched an appeal to get a retrial and is waiting to hear from the Supreme Court.

But in Japan, where the criminal justice system has a 99.9% conviction rate, clearing his name will not be easy.

Unexpected arrest

The youngest of six siblings, Iwao grew up in the seaside city of Hamamatsu, around two hours from Tokyo by train.

The family was poor but enjoyed a happy and stable environment, says Hideko Hakamada, Iwao's 86-year-old sister, who has campaigned to clear his name. Iwao now suffers from mental illness brought on by decades of imprisonment.

As children, the siblings went fishing by the seaside during summer and roasted garlic cloves amongst the fallen leaves in their yard in autumn. Only three years apart in age, Hideko and her little brother -- who she describes as calm and quiet -- were close. "He was like my shadow. He would follow me around everywhere," Hideko remembers.

Photos of Iwao Hakamada spread along the tatami mat at his home in Hamamatsu.

As the pair grew up, Hideko got married and Iwao started working in a bodybuilding gym. A colleague encouraged him to take up boxing.

and went on to fight 29 bouts. After his conviction, he was dubbed the "Japanese Rubin Carter" by some In 1959, at the age of 23, he started his professional career as a featherweight boxerand went on to fight 29 bouts. After his conviction, he was dubbed the "Japanese Rubin Carter" by some Western media . Carter was an American-Canadian boxer who was wrongfully convicted of murder but freed after serving almost 20 years in prison.

In 1961, Iwao retired after he fell ill and got a job as a factory worker at a soybean processing plant in Shizuoka. At the time, he was divorced and had a son.

On June 30, 1966, the news broke that Iwao's boss and family had been murdered in the early hours of the morning.

From the start, the odds were stacked against Iwao. As a former boxer and divorcee who had also worked in a bar, the police considered him a low-life and the most likely suspect, says Tsunogae.

On July 4, 1966, the police brought Iwao in for questioning.

Iwao Hakamada was briefly a professional boxer who fought 29 bouts.

At the time, many media outlets falsely reported that a blood-stained shirt found at the scene of the crime belonged to Iwao. The police let him go due to a lack of evidence and continued their investigations for a month.

After coming to a dead end, officers circled back to interviewing Iwao and his family members. Tsunogae alleges the police were desperate for a suspect and keen to pin the crime on Iwao.

They were taken to the police station and interrogated separately from morning till nightfall. Back at their mother's house, the family swapped notes about what they'd each been asked.

But Iwao was kept in solitary confinement at the station with no access to legal counsel. His ordeal was just beginning.

99% conviction rate

Japan puts far fewer people in prison than most developed countries: 39 per 100,000 people, compared with 655 in the US and 124 in Spain, according to the World Prison Brief website.

But in the US, for example, alleged offenders are entitled to remain silent during police questioning, have the right to legal representation both outside of and during questioning, and can make a deal to admit a less serious charge. This allows the prosecutor to drop a case and file an indictment from, for example, first degree murder to second degree murder.

By contrast, in Japan the accused can remain silent during police questioning, but suspects can be interrogated without the presence of a lawyer.

Though plea bargains were introduced in 2016, their use is limited to categories such as corporate malfeasance, according to Colin Jones, a law professor at Doshisha University, although defendants who cooperate can expect a more lenient sentence.

The 99% conviction rate is partly because prosecutors only pursue cases they believe will lead to a guilty verdict, according to Mark Ramseyer, a law professor at Harvard University.

"There are very few prosecutors in Japan. They are massively overworked. Given the workload, they focus first on the slam dunk, guilty-as-sin cases. They don't have time for the 'maybe he did it, maybe he didn't cases,'" says Ramseyer.

And because crime rates are so low in Japan, if someone is arrested or prosecuted, people generally assume they have done something wrong, says Jones.

"They only realize Japan's criminal justice system is not functioning when they are personally caught up in it," he says.

'Hostage justice' system?

Hideko says her brother fell victim to "hostage justice," when police allegedly strip suspects of their right to remain silent and coerce them to confess.

was subject to more than 240 hours of questioning for over 20 days, according to Kiyomi Tsunogae, a member of Iwao's defense team. The police and prosecutors initially Hideko claims there are no recordings that provide evidence that he confessed to mass murder. Hewas subject to more than 240 hours of questioning for over 20 days, according to Kiyomi Tsunogae, a member of Iwao's defense team. Thepolice and prosecutors initially alleged Iwao had been having an affair with his boss' wife and that she had asked him to murder her family and burn their house down so they could start a new life together. But officers discarded that theory after two days, she says.

Towards the end of the trial, they said he had wanted money.

Police in Japan can keep suspects detained for up to 23 days and repeatedly extend this deadline by filing new accusations. CNN asked the Japanese police whether the allegations that they used forced confessions during interrogations was true, but they provided no comment.

Confessions have long been the cornerstone of Japanese criminal justice. They are considered "the king of evidence" and "decisive element of proof" sought by every prosecutor and expected by most judges, David T. Johnson, an expert on the death penalty in Asia, wrote in a paper published in 2015.

In most democracies, a confession obtained after more than 200 hours of interrogation would be ruled as involuntary, unreliable, and inadmissible as evidence, adds Johnson. But not so in Japan.

In Iwao's case, police and prosecutors composed 45 confession statements, which they presented to the judges. Only one was accepted to be admissible as evidence.

In January, Nissan's Carlos Ghosn, who fled criminal prosecution in Japan, pointed to his time in solitary confinement and blasted the Japanese legal system, saying it "violates the most basic principles of humanity."

Japan's Justice Minister Masako Mori -- who will host the UN's Congress on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice in April -- refuted Ghosn's accusations. She said it was inappropriate to focus and compare particular parts of each country's justice system, without looking at how that system works as a whole.

Some legal experts say Japan's justice system keeps the country safe. Crime rates in 2019 hit a post-war low, according to data released by Japan's National Police Agency.

Iwao Hakamada pictured leaving a Tokyo detention in 2014 after 48 years on death row.

But over the decades, other high-profile cases have highlighted miscarriages of justice.

In 2009, Toshikazu Sugaya was freed in a rare judicial reversal that sent shock waves through the country's justice system. In 1990, he was falsely convicted of the rape and murder of a four-year-old girl following a confession extracted under duress.

The following year, in a separate case which became a scandal , a Japanese prosecutor acknowledged that he had tampered with evidence to secure the conviction of Muraki Atsuko , a health ministry official who was accused of postal fraud . His bosses allegedly knew the prosecutor had tampered with evidence, but tried to cover that fact up.

Since then, there have been reforms to Japan's justice system.

to serve alongside three professional judges in cases involving certain serious crimes. In 2009, Japan introduced a jury-like system where six lay judges are chosen from the electoral rollto servealongside three professional judges in cases involving certain serious crimes.

which include serious charges such as murder. In 2016, mandatory video recordings of interrogations were introduced , but critics say recordings only apply to 3% of the nation's criminal cases --which include serious charges such as murder.

Attempts to make investigators record interrogations have faced resistance from the police and prosecutors, who have tried to limit the scale and scope of those requirements, according to Osamu Niikura, a lawyer and member of the Japan Federation of Bar Associations (JFBA).

Furthermore, acquittals can be seen as detrimental to the careers of both judges and prosecutors.

But in Japan, the price for a miscarriage of justice can be death.

A thorny issue

Hideko used to think the death penalty was a reasonable punishment for those who committed terrible crimes, until she saw the effect its sentencing had on her brother.

For the first 20 years of imprisonment, Iwao believed that one day he would be set free. He applied himself to his studies, found solace in God, and wrote frequent letters home. In each one, he told his mom he was innocent and asked after his son.

Hideko says his optimism gave her hope.

Hideko Hakamada sits in her home in Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan on Monday Dec. 2, 2019. Hakamada worked for years fo are her brother Iwao prisons.

But in 1980, after Japan's Supreme Court finalized Iwao's death penalty, he was transferred to a prison exclusively for death row inmates.

The day after Iwao arrived there, the guards took the man in the cell next to his off to the gallows. "I thought they did that deliberately to break Iwao's spirit," says Hideko. "Iwao told me that that man shouted out his farewells to the other inmates as he was taken away."

Soon after, Iwao's letters home became more sporadic. His once clear handwriting slipped into scrawls. For over a decade starting from the 1990s, Hideko's attempts to see Iwao were rejected.

They were finally able to meet after Hideko appealed to a member of parliament in Tokyo for help. But when the siblings finally reunited, Iwao didn't seem to remember who he was, she says.

A letter that Iwao Hakamada wrote to his mother from prison, claiming his innocence, sits on tatami mat in Hamamatsu.

Unlike in the US where execution dates are set in advance, death row prisoners in Japan are executed in secret, with no advance warning given to the prisoner, their family nor legal representatives, according to Amnesty International.

Prisoners often only learn of their execution hours before it's due to take place. Japan justifies this by saying it is "out of consideration that an advance notice would disturb the inmate's peace of mind and might cause further suffering."

Usually, inmates must be executed within six months of their sentencing hearing. But Tsunogae says this rarely happens, and many end up waiting years.

Capital punishment is usually reserved for those who have committed multiple murders. All executions are carried out by hanging.

In Japan, the public supports the death penalty; 80% of respondents in a 2019 report released by the Cabinet Office said they were in favor. Only 9% opposed it.

'In his own world'

Over the decades, Iwao has garnered a loyal following of supporters.

Artists and sportsmen as well as non-profit groups and volunteers have all joined the call to clear his name, and cast a spotlight on the plight of death row inmates, who like Iwao can end up with mental illness.

In 2018, Iwao's former boxing association launched a petition supporting calls for a retrial. The following year, they commissioned a manga series on Iwao's life, saying boxers have a bad rap in Japan as the sport is not deemed as prestigious as judo and kendo.

That same year, Iwao and his sister traveled to Tokyo to attend a mass given by Pope Francis. Iwao was baptized as a Catholic in 1984 while in prison. His sister had hoped he could meet the Pope, who in 2018 called on all world leaders to abolish the death penalty, but their request went unanswered.

Over the decades, Amnesty International and Iwao's former boxing association have organized a series of small demonstrations in front of Japan's parliament.

Iwao Hakamada buys himself an ice cream as he takes his daily walk around Hamamatsu,

Though Iwao will likely never return to full mental health, Hideko says her brother has gotten healthier and lost the limp he had while on death row. He has a routine: he wakes early and goes for a four-hour stroll along the streets of Hamamatsu with a volunteer. "He's just in his own world now," says Hideko.

Hideko usually gives him 500 yen ($4) so he can buy himself snack on the walk. He sometimes ends up giving it to young children. Iwao has not seen his son since he went to prison, but Hideko suspects that he remembers that he once had a child.

Back at their shared home, Iwao is mostly silent. Once in a while, he contributes a word or two to the conversation before picking a Kleenex, which he neatly folds into squares -- a habit he picked up on death row, says Hideko.

Till this day, it is not clear who killed Iwao's boss, his boss' wife and their two children. Under Japanese law, Iwao is still recognized as a convicted killer under the sentence of death.

For now, Hideko says that the best thing for Iwao would be to remain free. Despite the odds, she is committed to clearing her brother's name and to changing people's perceptions of the death penalty.

"Society has prejudices against people who were on death row," says Hideko. "But someone who committed a crime, or who finds themselves on death row, is still a human." <_io.TextIOWrapper name='out.txt' mode='a' encoding='UTF-8'>
